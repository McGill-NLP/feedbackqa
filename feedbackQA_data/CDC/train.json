In public health emergencies, these conditions can\nalso isolate people from the resources they need to prepare for and respond to\noutbreaks.1,13, 14\nLiving conditions\nFor many people in racial and ethnic minority groups, living conditions may\ncontribute to underlying health conditions and make it difficult to follow\nsteps to prevent getting sick with COVID-19 or to seek treatment if they do\nget sick.\n\nMembers of racial and ethnic minorities may be more likely to live in densely populated areas because of institutional racism in the form of residential housing segregation. People living in densely populated areas may find it more difficult to practice prevention measures such as social distancing.\nResearch also suggests that racial residential segregation is a fundamental cause of health disparities. For example, racial residential segregation is linked with a variety of adverse health outcomes and underlying health conditions.2-5 These underlying conditions can also increase the likelihood of severe illness from COVID-19.\nMany members of racial and ethnic minorities live in neighborhoods that are further from grocery stores and medical facilities , making it more difficult to receive care if sick and stock up on supplies that would allow them to stay home.\nMulti-generational households , which may be more common among some racial and ethnic minority families6, may find it difficult to take precautions to protect older family members or isolate those who are sick, if space in the household is limited.\nRacial and ethnic minority groups are over-represented in jails, prisons, and detention centers , which have specific risks due to congregate living, shared food service, and more.\n\nWork circumstances\nThe types of work and policies in the work environments where people in some\nracial and ethnic groups are overrepresented can also contribute to their risk\nfor getting sick with COVID-19. Examples include:\n\nCritical workers: The risk of infection may be greater for workers in essential industries who continue to work outside the home despite outbreaks in their communities, including some people who may need to continue working in these jobs because of their economic circumstances. \nNearly a quarter of employed Hispanic and Black or African American workers are employed in service industry jobs compared to 16% of non-Hispanic whites.\nHispanic workers account for 17% of total employment but constitute 53% of agricultural workers; Black or African Americans make up 12% of all employed workers, but account for 30% of licensed practical and licensed vocational nurses.7\n\n\nA lack of paid sick leave: Workers without paid sick leave might be more likely to continue to work even when they are sick for any reason. This can increase workers exposure to other workers who may have COVID-19, or, in turn, expose others them if they themselves have COVID-19. Hispanic workers have lower rates of access to paid leave than white non-Hispanic workers.8\n\nUnderlying health conditions and lower access to care\nExisting health disparities, such as poorer underlying health and barriers to\ngetting health care, might make members of many racial and ethnic minority\ngroups especially vulnerable in public health emergencies like outbreaks of\nCOVID-19.\n\nNot having health insurance: Compared to whites, Hispanics are almost 3 times as likely to be uninsured, and African Americans are almost twice as likely to be uninsured.9 In all age groups, blacks were more likely than whites to report not being able to see a doctor in the past year because of cost.10\nInadequate access is also driven by a long-standing distrust of the health care system, language barriers, and financial implications associated with missing work to receive care.\nS erious underlying medical conditions : Compared to whites, black Americans experience higher death rates, and higher prevalence rates of chronic conditions.10\nStigma and systemic inequalities may undermine prevention efforts, increase levels of chronic and toxic stress, and ultimately sustain health and health care disparities.\n",

Be sure to alert your veterinarian if your pet has trouble breathing, or if you think it is an emergency.\nWhile most pets appear to show only mild symptoms or no symptoms, we are still learning about how they are affected by the virus. Even if your pet appears to be feeling better, avoid the following activities until your veterinarian determines that it is safe for your pet to do so or your pet has met the guidance to end their isolation: \nVisits to veterinary hospitals, without calling the veterinarian first\nVisits to human healthcare facilities or schools\nVisits to parks (including dog parks), markets, or other gatherings such as festivals\nVisits to the groomer, including mobile grooming salons\nVisits to pet daycares or boarding facilities\nOther outings such as playdates, hikes, or visiting other homes, with or without pets\nUsing dog walkers or pet-sitters that live outside your home\n\n\n\nSeparate your pet from other people and pets in your home\n\n\nHave the pet stay in a designated “sick room” (such as a laundry room or extra bathroom) if possible, or otherwise be separated from people and other animals. This is the same way a person with COVID-19 would separate from others in their household.\n\n\nAvoid contact with the pet as much as possible, including, petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food or bedding.\n\nIf possible, provide a separate litterbox or bathroom area from other pets.\n\nDOGS: If you have a private backyard where your dog can go to the bathroom, do\nnot take them for walks. If you must walk your dog, limit it to bathroom\nbreaks only, stay close to your home, and keep your pet at least 6 feet away\nfrom other pets and people. Do not let other people touch or interact with\nyour dog.\nCATS: Cats should be kept inside. Do not allow cats that have tested positive\nfor the virus that causes COVID-19 to roam outside.\nCLEANING UP: There is no evidence to suggest that waste from infected pets\nneeds any additional disinfection. Wear gloves when cleaning up after your\npet, and place fecal material or litterbox waste in a sealed bag before\ndisposing. Always wash your hands with soap and water immediately after\ncleaning up after your pet.\n\n\nProvide bedding, bowls or containers, treats, and toys that are separate from those used by other people or animals in the household.\n\n\n\nDisinfect bowls, toys, and other animal care items with an EPA-registered disinfectant and rinse thoroughly with clean water afterwards.\nSoft items like towels, blankets, and other bedding, can be safely laundered and reused. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with an ill animal can be washed with other items.\n\n\n\nMonitor your pet’s symptoms\nIt is important to keep track of your pet’s symptoms during home isolation. If\nyou think your pet has new symptoms or is getting worse, call your\nveterinarian.\nPets sick with COVID-19 may have:\n\nFever\nCoughing\nDifficulty breathing or shortness of breath\nLethargy (unusual laziness or sluggish)\nSneezing\nRunny nose\nEye discharge\nVomiting\nDiarrhea\n\nFollow all care instructions from your veterinarian. Your veterinarian may\nhave you keep a written log of your pet’s symptoms.\nIf your pet develops new symptoms or seems to be getting worse, including\ntrouble breathing, you should call your veterinarian right away. Your\nveterinarian may be able to advise you over the phone or may tell you to bring\nyour pet to their clinic or go to another clinic that can better care for your\npet.\nProtect yourself when caring for a sick pet\n\nFollow similar recommended precautions as for people caring for an infected person at home.\nIf you are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, another household member should care for the pet, if possible.\nPeople should wear a cloth face covering and gloves in the same room or area as the sick pet. \nAnimals should not wear a cloth face covering or mask. Do not try to put a cloth face covering on your pet.\n\n\nUse gloves when handling the pet’s dishes, toys, or bedding and when picking up feces (poop). Throw out gloves and place waste material or litterbox waste in a sealed bag before throwing away in a trashcan lined with a trash bag. Always wash your hands with soap and water immediately after cleaning up after your pet.\nClean your hands regularly throughout the day. \nWash hands: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds each Make sure everyone in the home does the same, especially after touching the sick pet or handling their dishes, toys, or bedding.\nHand sanitizer: If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.\nDo not touch your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\n\n\nClean and then disinfect: \nFollow cleaning and disinfecting recommendations found on CDC’s Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Home\nDo not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other products not intended or approved for use on animals. There is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people or other animals from the skin, fur, or hair of pets. Using chemical disinfectants on your pet could make them very sick or kill them.\n\n\n\nWhen it is safe for your pet to be around others: ending home isolation\n\n\nFollow your veterinarian’s advice for when it is safe for your pet to be around other people and animals. Some pets may need follow-up testing to see if they are still positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. If the animal is not being monitored by a veterinarian or public health official, owners should keep them isolated until:\n\n\n\n\nAt least 72 hours since their clinical signs of illness have resolved without the use of medications intended to relieve symptoms;\nAND\n\n\nAt least 14 days have passed since their clinical signs first appeared.\n\n\n\n",

                        "section_content": "Outbreaks of infectious diseases can happen on cruise ships because people\nspend time close together and with travelers from many countries. Disease can\nspread between ships when crew members from a ship with an outbreak transfer\nto other ships. Infected people may also travel on cruise ships between\ncountries. For these reasons, outbreaks of COVID-19 on cruise ships pose a\nrisk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage and into communities across\nthe globe.\nBecause of the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the high risk\nof COVID-19 spread on cruise ships, the US government issued a No Sail Order\nfor cruise ships in waters subject to US jurisdiction and has advised US\ntravelers to defer all cruise\ntravel.\nThe No Sail Order is published in the Federal\nRegister.\nCDC continues to work to control COVID-19 on cruise ships at sea while also\nprotecting against further introduction and spread of COVID-19 into\ncommunities. The COVID-19 pandemic is constantly evolving, and aggressive\nefforts are needed to contain the spread. CDC will continue to evaluate and\nupdate our recommendations as the situation evolves.\nWhat is the No Sail Order?\nIn response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and the increased risk of\nspread of COVID-19 on cruise ships, CDC published the first industry-wide No\nSail Order on March 14 to\nprevent, among other things, new passengers from boarding cruise ships. CDC\nextended its No Sail Order, effective April 15, 2020, to continue to suspend\nall cruise ship operations in waters subject to US jurisdiction. Among other\nthings, cruise lines are required to develop comprehensive plans to prevent,\ndetect, respond to, and contain COVID-19 on their cruise ships to protect the\nhealth and safety of both passengers and crew.\nHow long is the No Sail Order in effect?\nThe extended Order is in effect until one of the following occurs:\n\nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services declares that COVID-19 no longer constitutes a public health emergency, or\nThe CDC Director rescinds or modifies the order based on specific public health or other considerations, or\n100 days have passed from April 15, the date the extended order was published in the Federal Register and went into effect. 100 days from April 15 is July 24.\n\nWhy did CDC extend the No Sail Order?\nThe No Sail Order was extended to protect the public, cruise ship passengers,\ncruise ship crews, and other industry workers. By restricting cruise ship\npassenger operations, the Order helps achieve several public health goals:\n\nPrevents further spread of COVID-19 into and within the United States\nPreserves critical federal, state, and local resources that are needed to respond to COVID-19\nPreserves critical healthcare, emergency, and port resources\n\nWhat cruise ships does the No Sail Order cover?\nThe No Sail Order applies to all cruise ships, which it defines as commercial\npassenger ships with the capacity to carry more than 250 people and where an\novernight stay onboard by passengers or crew is anticipated. The Order applies\nto all cruise ships operating, or seeking to operate, in waters subject to US\njurisdiction, including those that have previously voluntarily suspended\noperations. It does not apply to cargo ships.\nWhat does the No Sail Order mean for my upcoming trip?\nPassengers who plan to travel by cruise ship should contact their cruise line\ncompanies directly for further information.\nOn March 17, 2020, CDC issued a Level 3 travel health\nnotice\nwith a clear recommendation to avoid all cruise travel due to ongoing spread\nof COVID-19 and the increased risk of person-to-person spread of infectious\ndiseases on cruise ships. The No Sail Order suspends all cruise ship\noperations in waters subject to US jurisdiction.\nWhat is CDC doing to help cruise ships with crew still on board?\nWe are currently in a phase of the pandemic where it is necessary to implement\nstrict measures to control the spread of COVID-19. Just as the American public\nhas a role to play in practicing social distancing, cruise lines have a role\nto play in properly caring for their crew, including making sure they can\npractice social distancing, isolating them if they are sick, and quarantining\nthem if they have been exposed to COVID-19.\nCDC is committed to the safety and well-being of crew members while onboard\nand as they disembark. CDC is allowing crew members to disembark from cruise\nships in U.S. waters and return home if cruise lines submit a signed\nattestation stating that they\nhave complied with requirements to safely disembark their crew members. Crew\nmembers who remain onboard and want to disembark should contact their cruise\nship or cruise line about meeting CDC requirements for safe disembarkation and\ntransport. A list of disembarkations that CDC has approved is available\nhere.\nCrew members on ships in or intending to be in US waters who have questions\nabout the process for disembarkation or who have concerns about what their\nship is doing to prevent COVID-19 onboard can share their questions or\nconcerns with CDC by sending an email to\neocevent431@cdc.gov.\nCruise ships have medical facilities on board that can provide medical care to\nsick crew members as needed. As part of their cruise ship plans, cruise lines\nshould make sure they have enough medical staff, equipment, supplies, and\nother resources to provide care for sick people on board. They also need a\nplan to transfer sick crew members to a hospital on land if they need medical\ncare that the ship’s medical facility can’t provide.\nCDC and federal partners are monitoring ships with crew only, and we are\nworking with the cruise companies and local and state health departments to\nensure that seriously ill crew members can get medical assistance on land if\nthe ship can’t provide it. CDC remains committed to humanitarian medical\nevacuation for people in need of lifesaving support. Emergency medical\nevacuations do not require CDC approval.\nWhat is CDC doing to help cruise ships with passengers still on board?\nA small number of passengers are still aboard cruise ships in and around US\nwaters.

                        "section_content_html": "<p>Outbreaks of infectious diseases can happen on cruise ships because people\nspend time close together and with travelers from many countries. Disease can\nspread between ships when crew members from a ship with an outbreak transfer\nto other ships. Infected people may also travel on cruise ships between\ncountries. For these reasons, outbreaks of COVID-19 on cruise ships pose a\nrisk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage and into communities across\nthe globe.</p>\n<p>Because of the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the high risk\nof COVID-19 spread on cruise ships, the US government issued a No Sail Order\nfor cruise ships in waters subject to US jurisdiction and has advised US\ntravelers to <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-cruise-ship\">defer all cruise\ntravel</a>.\nThe No Sail Order is published in the <a href=\"/quarantine/cruise/index.html\">Federal\nRegister</a>.</p>\n<p>CDC continues to work to control COVID-19 on cruise ships at sea while also\nprotecting against further introduction and spread of COVID-19 into\ncommunities. The COVID-19 pandemic is constantly evolving, and aggressive\nefforts are needed to contain the spread. CDC will continue to evaluate and\nupdate our recommendations as the situation evolves.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the No Sail Order?</strong></p>\n<p>In response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and the increased risk of\nspread of COVID-19 on cruise ships, CDC published the first industry-wide <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/cruise/index.html\">No\nSail Order</a> on March 14 to\nprevent, among other things, new passengers from boarding cruise ships. CDC\nextended its No Sail Order, effective April 15, 2020, to continue to suspend\nall cruise ship operations in waters subject to US jurisdiction. Among other\nthings, cruise lines are required to develop comprehensive plans to prevent,\ndetect, respond to, and contain COVID-19 on their cruise ships to protect the\nhealth and safety of both passengers and crew.</p>\n<p><strong>How long is the No Sail Order in effect?</strong></p>\n<p>The extended Order is in effect until one of the following occurs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Secretary of Health and Human Services declares that COVID-19 no longer constitutes a public health emergency, or</li>\n<li>The CDC Director rescinds or modifies the order based on specific public health or other considerations, or</li>\n<li>100 days have passed from April 15, the date the extended order was published in the <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/04/15/2020-07930/no-sail-order-and-suspension-of-further-embarkation-notice-of-modification-and-extension-and-other\">Federal Register</a> and went into effect. 100 days from April 15 is July 24.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why did CDC extend the No Sail Order?</strong></p>\n<p>The No Sail Order was extended to protect the public, cruise ship passengers,\ncruise ship crews, and other industry workers. By restricting cruise ship\npassenger operations, the Order helps achieve several public health goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevents further spread of COVID-19 into and within the United States</li>\n<li>Preserves critical federal, state, and local resources that are needed to respond to COVID-19</li>\n<li>Preserves critical healthcare, emergency, and port resources</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What cruise ships does the No Sail Order cover?</strong></p>\n<p>The No Sail Order applies to all cruise ships, which it defines as commercial\npassenger ships with the capacity to carry more than 250 people and where an\novernight stay onboard by passengers or crew is anticipated. The Order applies\nto all cruise ships operating, or seeking to operate, in waters subject to US\njurisdiction, including those that have previously voluntarily suspended\noperations. It does not apply to cargo ships.</p>\n<p><strong>What does the No Sail Order mean for my upcoming trip?</strong></p>\n<p>Passengers who plan to travel by cruise ship should contact their cruise line\ncompanies directly for further information.</p>\n<p>On March 17, 2020, CDC issued a <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-cruise-ship\">Level 3 travel health\nnotice</a>\nwith a clear recommendation to avoid all cruise travel due to ongoing spread\nof COVID-19 and the increased risk of person-to-person spread of infectious\ndiseases on cruise ships. The No Sail Order suspends all cruise ship\noperations in waters subject to US jurisdiction.</p>\n<p><strong>What is CDC doing to help cruise ships with crew still on board?</strong></p>\n<p>We are currently in a phase of the pandemic where it is necessary to implement\nstrict measures to control the spread of COVID-19. Just as the American public\nhas a role to play in practicing social distancing, cruise lines have a role\nto play in properly caring for their crew, including making sure they can\npractice social distancing, isolating them if they are sick, and quarantining\nthem if they have been exposed to COVID-19.</p>\n<p>CDC is committed to the safety and well-being of crew members while onboard\nand as they disembark. CDC is allowing crew members to disembark from cruise\nships in U.S. waters and return home if cruise lines submit a <a href=\"/quarantine/pdf/Attestation-for-Non-Commercial-Travel-Pre-\nApproval-of-NSO-Response-Plan_042320_final_fillable-p.pdf\">signed\nattestation</a> stating that they\nhave complied with requirements to safely disembark their crew members. Crew\nmembers who remain onboard and want to disembark should contact their cruise\nship or cruise line about meeting CDC requirements for safe disembarkation and\ntransport. A list of disembarkations that CDC has approved is available\n<a href=\"/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/cruise-ship/cruise-ship-member-\ndisembarkations.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Crew members on ships in or intending to be in US waters who have questions\nabout the process for disembarkation or who have concerns about what their\nship is doing to prevent COVID-19 onboard can share their questions or\nconcerns with CDC by sending an email to\n<a href=\"mailto:eocevent431@cdc.gov\">eocevent431@cdc.gov</a>.</p>\n<p>Cruise ships have medical facilities on board that can provide medical care to\nsick crew members as needed. As part of their cruise ship plans, cruise lines\nshould make sure they have enough medical staff, equipment, supplies, and\nother resources to provide care for sick people on board. They also need a\nplan to transfer sick crew members to a hospital on land if they need medical\ncare that the ship’s medical facility can’t provide.</p>\n<p>CDC and federal partners are monitoring ships with crew only, and we are\nworking with the cruise companies and local and state health departments to\nensure that seriously ill crew members can get medical assistance on land if\nthe ship can’t provide it. CDC remains committed to humanitarian medical\nevacuation for people in need of lifesaving support. Emergency medical\nevacuations do not require CDC approval.</p>\n<p><strong>What is CDC doing to help cruise ships with passengers still on board?</strong></p>\n<p>A small number of passengers are still aboard cruise ships in and around US\nwaters. These passengers are awaiting repatriation to their home countries.\nCDC is working with partners as part of the Unified Command, including Coast\nGuard, Customs and Border Protection, port authorities, local and state health\ndepartments, and Department of State, along with cruise lines, to help\nremaining cruise ship passengers get home as quickly and safely as possible.</p>\n<p>These are cruise ships that had international voyages with U.S. ports, and\ntherefore are under CDC jurisdiction.

Therefore, EPA cannot confirm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\nCDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that they are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage.\nCDC only recommends use of the surface disinfectants identified on List N against the virus that causes COVID-19.\n",

Employers should:</p>\n<p><strong>Reduce transmission among employees</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html\">steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 if </a>a driver is sick. <ul>\n<li>Actively encourage sick drivers to stay home.</li>\n<li>Sick drivers diagnosed with COVID-19 shouldn’t return to work until <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html\">the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met</a>, in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Provide drivers with accurate information about COVID-19, how it spreads, and risk of exposure. <ul>\n<li>Be aware that some drivers may be at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html\">higher risk</a> for serious illness, such as older adults and those with chronic medical conditions. Put in place specific policies to minimize face-to-face contact between these drivers, or assign work tasks that allow them to maintain a distance of six feet from other workers, customers, and visitors.</li>\n<li>Provide training to drivers on proper <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html\">handwashing</a> practices and other routine preventative measures. This will help prevent the spread of many diseases, including COVID-19.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Provide drivers with all PPE (including vests, safety glasses, hard hats) that they might need while on the road so that the driver does not need to borrow PPE from shippers.</li>\n<li>Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol for truck cabs.</li>\n<li>Provide tissues and small trash cans for truck cabs.</li>\n<li>Take additional precautions to address risks associated with ride-alongs or team driving (two drivers in the cab on a long-haul run) when they cannot be avoided. For example, install a removable barrier between the driver and passenger that does not obstruct the task of driving and/or to separate sleeper berth.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Maintain a healthy work environment</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conduct worksite assessments to identify COVID-19 prevention strategies.</li>\n<li>Institute measures to physically separate and increase distance between drivers, other coworkers, and customers, such as: <ul>\n<li>Develop policies and technology options that allow and encourage contactless deliveries, such as no-signature delivery. These options limit contact, provide space, and avoid the sharing of items like pens and electronic signature pads between drivers and individuals at the delivery location.</li>\n<li>During driver training situations, use virtual training methods and in-vehicle monitoring systems where possible. Limit ride-alongs and in-person classroom-based training. Follow all applicable federal motor carrier regulations and public health agency guidelines.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Place posters that encourage <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nonpharmaceutical-interventions/tools-resources/educational-materials.html\">staying home when sick</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/etiquette/coughing_sneezing.html\">cough and sneeze etiquette</a>, and proper <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/materials.html\">hand hygiene</a> practices on the dock and in other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen.</li>\n<li>Provide disposable disinfectant wipes so that surfaces commonly touched can be wiped down. To disinfect, use <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2\">products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2external icon</a>, diluted household bleach solutions, or alcohol solutions with at least 60% alcohol, and are appropriate for the surface. Provide drivers training on manufacturer’s directions for use; more detailed cleaning and disinfecting guidance is also <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/guidance-cleaning-and-disinfecting-public-spaces-workplaces-businesses-schools-and-homes\">availableexternal icon</a>.</li>\n<li>Pre-qualify truck stops, rest areas, and hotels to ensure such facilities are open, supplied, and follow recommended COVID-19 safety practices, such as: <ul>\n<li>cleanliness and disinfection (such as routine cleaning, available hand-sanitizing stations, and private showers);</li>\n<li>proper food handling and food service (such as replacing self-service with full service);</li>\n<li>contactless fuel payment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Follow all applicable local, state, and federal regulations and public health agency guidelines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Maintain healthy business operations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow the CDC guidance for <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/critical-workers/implementing-safety-practices.html\">critical infrastructure workers who may have had exposure to a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19</a>. <ul>\n<li>Reintegrating exposed, asymptomatic workers back to work, while discussed in the guidance, should not be misinterpreted as the first or most appropriate option.</li>\n<li>Home isolation may still be the most preferred and viable option for exposed workers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Designate a person who is responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. Drivers should know who this person is and how to contact them.</li>\n<li>Consider using a hotline for employees to voice concerns anonymously.</li>\n<li>Make a plan with your employees as to what to do if they become sick while on the road. Include where to stop, where and how to seek medical advice and treatment, and plans for freight delivery.</li>\n<li>Implement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices. Consider drafting non-punitive emergency sick leave policies if sick leave is not offered to some or all employees. Employers should not require a positive COVID-19 test result or a healthcare provider’s note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick leave, or to return to work.</li>\n<li>Provide information on who to contact if employees become sick. If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19 infection, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace, but maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).</li>\n<li>Reach out to local public health officials to establish ongoing communications to facilitate access to relevant information before and during a local outbreak.</li>\n<li>Schedule driver routes to allow for adequate sleep, and use <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/motorvehicle/topics/driverfatigue/default.html\">fatigue management strategies</a>.</li>\n<li>Understand that the current environment could elevate stress levels among drivers. Provide resources to help manage stress.</li>\n</ul>"

Small construction businesses should review the\nCDC small business\nguidelines. Your employer should take steps to:\nReduce transmission among workers:\n\nTake steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 if an employee is sick. \nActively encourage sick employees to stay home.\nSick employees diagnosed with COVID-19 shouldn’t return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments.\n\n\nProvide employees with accurate information (in a language they understand) about COVID-19, how it spreads, and risk of exposure. \nProvide workers with basic facts.\nConduct toolbox talks on all job sites to explain the protective measures in place.\n\n\nBe aware that some employees may be at higher risk for severe illness, such as older adults and those with underlying medical conditions. Implement specific policies to minimize face-to-face contact for these employees or assign work tasks that allow them to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from other workers, customers, and visitors, or to telework if possible.\nProvide training to employees on proper handwashing practices and other routine preventative measures. This will help prevent the spread of many diseases, including COVID-19.\nProvide employees with access to soap, clean running water, and materials for drying their hands, or if soap and water are not readily available provide alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol at stations around the establishment for use by both workers and customers. \nPlace handwashing stations and/or hand sanitizers in multiple locations (including in or adjacent to portable restrooms) to encourage hand hygiene.\n\n\nExplore alternative ways to promote hand hygiene if there is difficulty sourcing hand sanitizer and running water is not available on site. Some examples may include: \nInstall temporary or mobile handwashing stations, making sure there is an adequate supply of water, soap, and single-use paper towels.\nProvide a large (5+ gallon) bucket with a lid and tap that can be used to provide water for handwashing. If this method is used, the water tap should be regularly cleaned and disinfected, and the contaminated wastewater must be collected and treated in accordance with local laws and environmental regulations. Provide fresh clean water daily.\nDepending on the size or configuration of the job site, there may need to be multiple handwashing stations available to accommodate the workforce while maintaining social distancing, and stations may need to be restocked during the course of the day to maintain adequate handwashing supplies.\n\n\nDevelop and implement social distancing guidance for the workplace to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between workers when possible.\n\nMaintain a healthy work environment\n\nInstitute measures to physically separate and increase distance between employees, such as the following: \nModify work schedules to stagger work, provide alternating workdays or extra shifts to reduce the total number of workers on a job site at any given time.\nRestrict access to reduce the number of workers in enclosed and confined areas at one time. Confined and enclosed areas (e.g., trailers, small rooms in buildings under construction) should be identified and access should be restricted to essential personnel only. Enclosed spaces (e.g., toilets, break areas) are potential transmission areas and should be treated accordingly. Time spent in these areas should be minimized.\nRearrange administrative area workstations so that workers can stay at least 6 feet away from other workers.\nInstall shields or barriers, such as plexiglass barriers, where possible.\nRemove or rearrange chairs and tables or add visual cue marks in break areas to support social distancing practices between workers. Identify alternative areas to accommodate overflow volume.\nDisinfect break or lunchroom areas between each group using the areas.\nMaintain social distancing when visiting lunch trucks or construction site vendors.\nLimit casual (social) conversations that normally occur at work.\nCancel or postpone in-person meetings/trainings whenever possible. If you must meet, spread out to a distance of 6 feet or more between attendees.\nReduce the number of individuals at meetings, including worker orientations, to increase the distance between individuals.\n\n\nConduct a hazard assessment to determine if hazards are present, or are likely to be present, for which workers may need personal protective equipment (PPE). CDC and OSHA have recommended PPE for some types of work activities when engineering and administrative controls cannot be implemented or are not fully protective. \nEmployers are required to determine, select, provide, and train on correct PPE use and application for their workers’ specific job duties (see 29 CFR 1926 Subpart Eexternal icon).\n\n\nPlace posters that encourage staying home when sick, cough and sneeze etiquette, signs and symptoms of COVID-19, and proper hand hygiene practices at the entrance to the workplace and in other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen.\nProvide tissues and no-touch disposal receptacles for employees to use.\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. If the surfaces are visibly dirty, clean them prior to disinfecting. To disinfect, use products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2external icon, diluted household bleach solutions that are prepared according to the manufacturer’s label for disinfection, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, and that are appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer’s directions for use. \nClean workspaces and breakrooms at least once per shift or as often as workers change workstations.\nProvide worker training on manufacturer’s directions for disinfectant use and provide workers with any additional PPE required for disinfection.\n\n\nProvide disposable disinfectant wipes (when available) so that surfaces commonly touched can be wiped down.\nFollow all applicable local, state, and federal regulations and public health agency guidelines.\n\nMaintain healthy business operations\n\nDesignate a safety and health officer to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns at every jobsite. Workers should know who this person is and how to contact them.\nImplement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices. Consider drafting non-punitive emergency sick leave policies if sick leave is not offered to some or all employees. Employers should not require a positive COVID-19 test result or a healthcare provider’s note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick leave, or to return to work.\nProvide information on whom to contact if employees become sick. If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19 infection, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace but maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\nReach out to local public health officials to establish ongoing communications to facilitate access to relevant information before and during a local outbreak.\n",

Pilots’ associations should train and designate a competent person\nat each work site to ensure the plan is implemented and has the knowledge and\nauthority to recognize hazards and address them on vessels. Pilots’\nassociations should take steps to:</p>\n<h3>Reduce transmission while on piloted vessels</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Conduct a hazard assessment before boarding each vessel to determine if hazards are present, or are likely to be present, for which workers may need PPE. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/index.html\">CDC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3990.pdf\">OSHApdf iconexternal icon</a> have recommended PPE for some types of work activities when engineering and administrative controls are not able to be implemented or are not fully protective. Employers are required to determine, select, provide, and train on correct PPE use and application for their workers’ specific job duties.</li>\n<li>Report pilot boat or vessel crew who exhibit COVID-19 symptoms to the nearest Captain of the Port (COTP).</li>\n<li>With the cooperation of local authorities and COTP, consider advising vessels planning to engage a pilot that they must take the following precautions prior to the pilot boarding: <ul>\n<li>Immediately prior to pilot boarding, use an <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2\">product that meets EPA’s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2,external icon</a> against the virus that causes COVID-19 to wipe down any surface that the pilot might be anticipated to touch, such as: bridge equipment, radar, ECDIS controls, VHF radios, helm and machinery controls, the interior buttons of any elevator, and staircase hand railings that the pilot may use. If EPA-approved disinfectant is not available, a diluted bleach solution prepared according to the manufacturer’s label for disinfection can be used.</li>\n<li>Provide a one-person escort for the pilot to and from the bridge following a path of minimum exposure to anyone on board. If equipped, only the pilot and the escort will be permitted in the elevator to and from the bridge.</li>\n<li>Allow only essential personnel on the bridge while a pilot is on board.</li>\n<li>Anyone entering the bridge must thoroughly wash their hands immediately prior to entering. Hand soap and paper towels should be available in the bridge head for this purpose.</li>\n<li>All aboard shall maintain a minimum 6 feet from the pilot and each other to the extent feasible.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Reduce transmission among pilots and employees while in the office or on</h3>\n<p>pilot boat</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 if a pilot or employee becomes sick. <ul>\n<li>Actively encourage sick pilots and employees to stay home.</li>\n<li>Sick pilots and employees should not return to work until the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html\">criteria to discontinue home isolation</a> are met, in consultation with healthcare providers. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html\">Clean and disinfect</a> any areas that symptomatic individuals have had access to. Inform client vessels with individuals suspected/confirmed to have COVID-19, that they should clean and disinfect their vessels appropriately.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Provide and train pilots and employees with accurate information (in their native language) about COVID-19, how it spreads, risk of exposure, the designated competent person, and how to contact them. <ul>\n<li>Be aware that some pilots or employees may be <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html\">at higher risk for serious illness</a>, such as older adults and those with chronic medical conditions. Implement specific policies to minimize face-to-face contact between these pilots and employees or assign work tasks that allow them to maintain a distance of at least six feet from other workers, customers, and visitors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Institute measures to physically separate and increase distance between employees and others, such as: <ul>\n<li>Rearrange workstations and break rooms at the port office so that employees can stay at least 6 feet away from other employees (i.e., use alternative work areas such as conference and training rooms).</li>\n<li>Reduce staffing levels on each shift or implement telework policies, where applicable.</li>\n<li>Implement on call protocols to reduce the number of employees at the port office at a given time.</li>\n<li>Provide technology solutions to reduce the need for face-to-face communication.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Provide pilots and employees training on proper <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html\">handwashing</a> practices, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html\">cough and sneeze etiquette,</a> and other routine infection control precautions. This will help prevent the spread of many diseases, including COVID-19.</li>\n<li>Provide pilots and employees with access to soap, clean running water, and materials for drying their hands, and provide hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Maintain a healthy work environment</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Place posters that encourage <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/print-resources.html\">staying home when sick, cough and sneeze etiquette, and good hand hygiene</a> at the entrance to the office and in other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen.</li>\n<li>Provide tissues and no-touch disposal receptacles for use by pilots and employees.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html\">Clean and disinfect</a> frequently touched surfaces on a routine basis: <ul>\n<li>In break rooms, rest rooms, and office spaces: such as telephones, door handles, keyboards, card readers, radios and electronics.</li>\n<li>On pilot boats, such as door handles, control panels chart table, armrests, headsets, radio controls, and mics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If the surfaces are visibly dirty, clean them prior to disinfecting. To disinfect, use <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2\">products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2,external icon</a> diluted household bleach solutions prepared according to the manufacturer’s label for disinfection, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, and are appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer’s directions for use.</li>\n<li>Provide disposable disinfectant wipes, cleaner, or spray so employees can clean and disinfect surfaces as needed.</li>\n<li>Follow all applicable local, state, and federal regulations and public health agency guidelines.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Maintain healthy business operations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices. Consider drafting non-punitive “emergency sick leave” policies if sick leave is not offered to some or all employees.</li>\n<li>Provide information on who to contact if pilots or employees become sick. If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19 infection, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace but maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).</li>\n</ul>"

This occurred\nwith <a href=\"/coronavirus/mers/index.html\">MERS-CoV</a> and <a href=\"/sars/index.html\">SARS-\nCoV</a>, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19. The SARS-\nCoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of\nthese viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are\nsimilar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single,\nrecent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir. However, the exact\nsource of this virus is unknown.</p>\n<p>More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the\n<a href=\"/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/summary.html#emergence\">Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the\nVirus</a>.</p>"

Scientists are conducting\nresearch to answer those questions.</p>\n<p>Antibody tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected\nbecause it typically takes 1 to 3 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.\nTo tell if you are currently infected, you would need a test that identifies\nthe virus in samples from your upper respiratory system, such as a\nnasopharyngeal swab.</p>"

There have not been any reports of\nhorses testing positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the\nlimited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading the virus\nthat causes COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. COVID-19 is primarily\nspread from person to person, so steps should be taken to reduce the risks for\npeople visiting your facility.\n\nEncourage employees and other visitors, including boarders, owners, farriers, veterinarians, and those taking lessons, not to enter the facility if they are sick. Employees should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, after talking with their doctor. Implement sick leave policies that are flexible, nonpunitive, and consistent with public health guidance, allowing employees to stay home if they have symptoms of respiratory infection.\nConsider conducting daily health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees and others visiting the facility before they enter the premises. People with a fever of 100.40(38.00C) or above or other signs of illness should not be admitted to the premises. If implementing health checks, conduct them safely and respectfully. See General Business FAQs for more information. \nEmployees or visitors who appear to have symptoms upon arrival or who become sick during their visit should immediately be separated from other employees and visitors and sent home.\n\n\nLimit the number of people entering the facility. Consider staggering lesson and visiting times to limit the number of people in the facility and potential for person-to-person contact. If possible, you can also take steps to decrease high-traffic areas by limiting areas open to visitors/owners or staggering use of common areas like grooming or wash stalls and tack rooms.\nIncrease distance and limit duration of contact between employees and visitors in the facility.

Examples to consider\nthat incorporate these types of controls for temperature screening include:\n\nReliance on Social Distancing : Ask employees to take their own temperature either before coming to the workplace or upon arrival at the workplace. Upon their arrival, stand at least 6 feet away from the employee and: \nAsk the employee to confirm that their temperature is less than 100.4o F (38.0o C), and confirm that they are not experiencing coughing or shortness of breath.\nMake a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue.\nScreening staff do not need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) if they can maintain a distance of 6 feet.\n\n\nReliance on Barrier/Partition Controls : During screening, the screener stands behind a physical barrier, such as a glass or plastic window or partition, that can protect the screener’s face and mucous membranes from respiratory droplets that may be produced when the employee sneezes, coughs, or talks. Upon arrival, the screener should wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, if soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Then: \nMake a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue.\nConduct temperature and symptom screening using this protocol: \nPut on disposable gloves.\nCheck the employee’s temperature, reaching around the partition or through the window. Make sure the screener’s face stays behind the barrier at all times during the screening.\nIf performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, make sure that you use a clean pair of gloves for each employee and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check. If disposable or non-contact thermometers are used and you did not have physical contact with an individual, you do not need to change gloves before the next check. If non-contact thermometers are used, clean and disinfect them according to manufacturer’s instructions and facility policies.\nRemove and discard PPE (gloves), and wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

                        "section_content": "Yes. To keep patients and healthcare personnel (HCP) healthy and safe, CDC’s\ninfection prevention and control guidance applies to all settings where\nhealthcare is delivered. However, as with any guidance, facilities can tailor\ncertain recommendations to their setting. For example, inpatient psychiatric\ncare includes communal experiences and group activities that may need to\ncontinue. If so, these activities might need to be adapted to align with\nsocial distancing recommendations. Other recommended infection control measures\n(for example, ensuring access to alcohol-based hand sanitizer, cohorting\npatients with COVID-19 and assigning dedicated staff, or implementing\nuniversal source control measures) might not be safe or appropriate to\nimplement in all locations or for all patients due to security and behavioral\nconcerns.\nChallenges and potential solutions specific to behavioral health settings\nmight include:\n\nCohorting \nChallenge: To prevent transmission, it is generally recommended that patients with COVID-19 be transferred to a separate area of the facility where they can be cared for by dedicated HCP. Because of security concerns or specialized care needs, it might not be possible to cohort certain patients together or change HCP assigned to their care.\nPotential Solutions: When cohorting is not possible, implement measures to maintain social distancing (at least 6 feet) between patients with COVID-19 and others on the unit. Ideally, this would include a separate bathroom for COVID-19 patients. Ensure HCP wear all recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.\n\n\nGroup Therapy Sessions \nChallenge : Group counseling, therapy, and discussion sessions are a critical component of psychiatric treatment and care plans, but the traditional set-up for these activities is not compatible with social distancing recommendations.\nPotential Solutions : When possible, use virtual methods, or decrease group size so social distancing can be maintained. In the event that COVID-19 is transmitted in the facility, sessions should stop or move to a video discussion forum until additional infection prevention measures are in place to stop the spread.\n\n\nCloth Face Coverings \nChallenge: For some patients, the use of cloth face coverings or facemasks might pose an additional danger or may cause distress. Some patients may be unable or unwilling to use them as intended. Elastic and cloth straps can be used for strangling oneself or others, and metal nasal bridges can be used for self-harm or as a weapon.\nPotential Solutions: Consider allowing patients at low risk for misuse to wear cloth face coverings or facemasks, with a preference for those with short ear-loops rather than longer ties. Consider use of cloth face coverings or facemasks during supervised group activities. Ensure that HCP interacting with patients who cannot wear a cloth face covering or facemask are wearing eye protection and a facemask (or a respirator if the patient is suspected to have COVID-19 and respirators are available).\n\n\nAlcohol-based Hand Sanitizer \nChallenge : While alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS) containing 60-95% alcohol is an important tool to increase adherence to hand hygiene recommendations, ABHS must be used carefully in psychiatric facilities to ensure it is not ingested by patients.\nPotential Solutions : Consider not placing ABHS in patients’ rooms in psychiatric facilities, nor in locations where the patients have unsupervised access. Encourage frequent hand washing with soap and water for patients and HCP. Consider providing personal, pocket-sized ABHS dispensers for HCP.\n\n\nDining \nChallenge : As part of social distancing, communal dining is generally not recommended. However, eating needs to remain supervised due to the potential for self-harm with eating utensils and because commonly used psychiatric medications may cause side effects (e.g., tardive dyskinesia, dysphagia, hypo- and hypersalivation) that increase choking risk for patients.\nPotential Solutions : One option is to position staff in patients’ rooms to monitor their dining. Another option is to allow communal dining in shifts so that staff can monitor patients while ensuring they remain at least 6 feet apart. A third option is to have patients sit in appropriately spaced chairs in the hallway outside their rooms so they can be monitored while they eat.\n\n\nSmoking \nChallenge: A higher proportion of psychiatric patients smoke cigarettes compared to the general population. Patients might congregate in outdoor smoking spaces without practicing appropriate social distancing.\nPotential Solutions: Limit the number of patients allowed to access smoking spacesat the same time, and position staff to observe and ensure patients are practicing appropriate physical distancing.\n\n\n",

N95 respirators are tight-fitting respirators that filter out at least 95% of particles in the air, including large and small particles.\nNot everyone is able to wear a respirator due to medical conditions that may be made worse when breathing through a respirator. Before using a respirator or getting fit-tested, workers must have a medical evaluation to make sure that they are able to wear a respirator safely.\nAchieving an adequate seal to the face is essential. United States regulations require that workers undergo an annual fit test and conduct a user seal check each time the respirator is used.
