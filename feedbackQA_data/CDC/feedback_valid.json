Small construction businesses should review the\nCDC small business\nguidelines. Your employer should take steps to:\nReduce transmission among workers:\n\nTake steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 if an employee is sick. \nActively encourage sick employees to stay home.\nSick employees diagnosed with COVID-19 shouldn\u2019t return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments.\n\n\nProvide employees with accurate information (in a language they understand) about COVID-19, how it spreads, and risk of exposure. \nProvide workers with basic facts.\nConduct toolbox talks on all job sites to explain the protective measures in place.\n\n\nBe aware that some employees may be at higher risk for severe illness, such as older adults and those with underlying medical conditions. Implement specific policies to minimize face-to-face contact for these employees or assign work tasks that allow them to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from other workers, customers, and visitors, or to telework if possible.\nProvide training to employees on proper handwashing practices and other routine preventative measures. This will help prevent the spread of many diseases, including COVID-19.\nProvide employees with access to soap, clean running water, and materials for drying their hands, or if soap and water are not readily available provide alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol at stations around the establishment for use by both workers and customers. \nPlace handwashing stations and/or hand sanitizers in multiple locations (including in or adjacent to portable restrooms) to encourage hand hygiene.\n\n\nExplore alternative ways to promote hand hygiene if there is difficulty sourcing hand sanitizer and running water is not available on site. Some examples may include: \nInstall temporary or mobile handwashing stations, making sure there is an adequate supply of water, soap, and single-use paper towels.\nProvide a large (5+ gallon) bucket with a lid and tap that can be used to provide water for handwashing. If this method is used, the water tap should be regularly cleaned and disinfected, and the contaminated wastewater must be collected and treated in accordance with local laws and environmental regulations. Provide fresh clean water daily.\nDepending on the size or configuration of the job site, there may need to be multiple handwashing stations available to accommodate the workforce while maintaining social distancing, and stations may need to be restocked during the course of the day to maintain adequate handwashing supplies.\n\n\nDevelop and implement social distancing guidance for the workplace to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between workers when possible.\n\nMaintain a healthy work environment\n\nInstitute measures to physically separate and increase distance between employees, such as the following: \nModify work schedules to stagger work, provide alternating workdays or extra shifts to reduce the total number of workers on a job site at any given time.\nRestrict access to reduce the number of workers in enclosed and confined areas at one time. Confined and enclosed areas (e.g., trailers, small rooms in buildings under construction) should be identified and access should be restricted to essential personnel only. Enclosed spaces (e.g., toilets, break areas) are potential transmission areas and should be treated accordingly. Time spent in these areas should be minimized.\nRearrange administrative area workstations so that workers can stay at least 6 feet away from other workers.\nInstall shields or barriers, such as plexiglass barriers, where possible.\nRemove or rearrange chairs and tables or add visual cue marks in break areas to support social distancing practices between workers. Identify alternative areas to accommodate overflow volume.\nDisinfect break or lunchroom areas between each group using the areas.\nMaintain social distancing when visiting lunch trucks or construction site vendors.\nLimit casual (social) conversations that normally occur at work.\nCancel or postpone in-person meetings/trainings whenever possible. If you must meet, spread out to a distance of 6 feet or more between attendees.\nReduce the number of individuals at meetings, including worker orientations, to increase the distance between individuals.\n\n\nConduct a hazard assessment to determine if hazards are present, or are likely to be present, for which workers may need personal protective equipment (PPE). CDC and OSHA have recommended PPE for some types of work activities when engineering and administrative controls cannot be implemented or are not fully protective. \nEmployers are required to determine, select, provide, and train on correct PPE use and application for their workers\u2019 specific job duties (see 29 CFR 1926 Subpart Eexternal icon).\n\n\nPlace posters that encourage staying home when sick, cough and sneeze etiquette, signs and symptoms of COVID-19, and proper hand hygiene practices at the entrance to the workplace and in other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen.\nProvide tissues and no-touch disposal receptacles for employees to use.\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. If the surfaces are visibly dirty, clean them prior to disinfecting. To disinfect, use products that meet EPA\u2019s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2external icon, diluted household bleach solutions that are prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s label for disinfection, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, and that are appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer\u2019s directions for use. \nClean workspaces and breakrooms at least once per shift or as often as workers change workstations.\nProvide worker training on manufacturer\u2019s directions for disinfectant use and provide workers with any additional PPE required for disinfection.\n\n\nProvide disposable disinfectant wipes (when available) so that surfaces commonly touched can be wiped down.\nFollow all applicable local, state, and federal regulations and public health agency guidelines.\n\nMaintain healthy business operations\n\nDesignate a safety and health officer to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns at every jobsite. Workers should know who this person is and how to contact them.\nImplement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices. Consider drafting non-punitive emergency sick leave policies if sick leave is not offered to some or all employees. Employers should not require a positive COVID-19 test result or a healthcare provider\u2019s note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick leave, or to return to work.\nProvide information on whom to contact if employees become sick. If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19 infection, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace but maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\nReach out to local public health officials to establish ongoing communications to facilitate access to relevant information before and during a local outbreak.\n",

This will help prevent the spread of many diseases, including COVID-19.</li>\n<li>Provide employees with access to soap, clean running water, and materials for drying their hands, or if soap and water are not readily available provide alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol at stations around the establishment for use by both workers and customers. <ul>\n<li>Place handwashing stations and/or hand sanitizers in multiple locations (including in or adjacent to portable restrooms) to encourage hand hygiene.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Explore alternative ways to promote hand hygiene if there is difficulty sourcing hand sanitizer and running water is not available on site. Some examples may include: <ul>\n<li>Install temporary or mobile handwashing stations, making sure there is an adequate supply of water, soap, and single-use paper towels.</li>\n<li>Provide a large (5+ gallon) bucket with a lid and tap that can be used to provide water for handwashing. If this method is used, the water tap should be regularly cleaned and disinfected, and the contaminated wastewater must be collected and treated in accordance with local laws and environmental regulations. Provide fresh clean water daily.</li>\n<li>Depending on the size or configuration of the job site, there may need to be multiple handwashing stations available to accommodate the workforce while maintaining social distancing, and stations may need to be restocked during the course of the day to maintain adequate handwashing supplies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Develop and implement social distancing guidance for the workplace to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between workers when possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Maintain a healthy work environment</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Institute measures to physically separate and increase distance between employees, such as the following: <ul>\n<li>Modify work schedules to stagger work, provide alternating workdays or extra shifts to reduce the total number of workers on a job site at any given time.</li>\n<li>Restrict access to reduce the number of workers in enclosed and confined areas at one time. Confined and enclosed areas (e.g., trailers, small rooms in buildings under construction) should be identified and access should be restricted to essential personnel only. Enclosed spaces (e.g., toilets, break areas) are potential transmission areas and should be treated accordingly. Time spent in these areas should be minimized.</li>\n<li>Rearrange administrative area workstations so that workers can stay at least 6 feet away from other workers.</li>\n<li>Install shields or barriers, such as plexiglass barriers, where possible.</li>\n<li>Remove or rearrange chairs and tables or add visual cue marks in break areas to support social distancing practices between workers. Identify alternative areas to accommodate overflow volume.</li>\n<li>Disinfect break or lunchroom areas between each group using the areas.</li>\n<li>Maintain social distancing when visiting lunch trucks or construction site vendors.</li>\n<li>Limit casual (social) conversations that normally occur at work.</li>\n<li>Cancel or postpone in-person meetings/trainings whenever possible. If you must meet, spread out to a distance of 6 feet or more between attendees.</li>\n<li>Reduce the number of individuals at meetings, including worker orientations, to increase the distance between individuals.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Conduct a hazard assessment to determine if hazards are present, or are likely to be present, for which workers may need personal protective equipment (PPE). CDC and OSHA have recommended PPE for some types of work activities when engineering and administrative controls cannot be implemented or are not fully protective. <ul>\n<li>Employers are required to determine, select, provide, and train on correct PPE use and application for their workers\u2019 specific job duties (see <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1926/1926SubpartE\">29 CFR 1926 Subpart Eexternal icon</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Place <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/print-resources.html\">posters</a> that encourage <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nonpharmaceutical-interventions/tools-resources/educational-materials.html\">staying home when sick</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/etiquette/coughing_sneezing.html\">cough and sneeze etiquette</a>, signs and symptoms of COVID-19, and proper <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/materials.html\">hand hygiene</a> practices at the entrance to the workplace and in other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen.</li>\n<li>Provide tissues and no-touch disposal receptacles for employees to use.</li>\n<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. If the surfaces are visibly dirty, clean them prior to disinfecting. To disinfect, use products that meet <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2\">EPA\u2019s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2external icon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html\">diluted household bleach solutions</a> that are prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s label for disinfection, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, and that are appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer\u2019s directions for use. <ul>\n<li>Clean workspaces and breakrooms at least once per shift or as often as workers change workstations.</li>\n<li>Provide worker training on manufacturer\u2019s directions for disinfectant use and provide workers with any additional PPE required for disinfection.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Provide disposable disinfectant wipes (when available) so that surfaces commonly touched can be wiped down.</li>\n<li>Follow all applicable local, state, and federal regulations and public health agency guidelines.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Maintain healthy business operations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Designate a safety and health officer to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns at every jobsite. Workers should know who this person is and how to contact them.</li>\n<li>Implement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices. Consider drafting non-punitive emergency sick leave policies if sick leave is not offered to some or all employees. Employers should not require a positive COVID-19 test result or a healthcare provider\u2019s note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick leave, or to return to work.</li>\n<li>Provide information on whom to contact if employees become sick. If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19 infection, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace but maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).</li>\n<li>Reach out to local public health officials to establish ongoing communications to facilitate access to relevant information before and during a local outbreak.</li>\n</ul>"

                        "section_content": "Outbreaks of infectious diseases can happen on cruise ships because people\nspend time close together and with travelers from many countries. Disease can\nspread between ships when crew members from a ship with an outbreak transfer\nto other ships. Infected people may also travel on cruise ships between\ncountries. For these reasons, outbreaks of COVID-19 on cruise ships pose a\nrisk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage and into communities across\nthe globe.\nBecause of the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the high risk\nof COVID-19 spread on cruise ships, the US government issued a No Sail Order\nfor cruise ships in waters subject to US jurisdiction and has advised US\ntravelers to defer all cruise\ntravel.\nThe No Sail Order is published in the Federal\nRegister.\nCDC continues to work to control COVID-19 on cruise ships at sea while also\nprotecting against further introduction and spread of COVID-19 into\ncommunities. The COVID-19 pandemic is constantly evolving, and aggressive\nefforts are needed to contain the spread. CDC will continue to evaluate and\nupdate our recommendations as the situation evolves.\nWhat is the No Sail Order?\nIn response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and the increased risk of\nspread of COVID-19 on cruise ships, CDC published the first industry-wide No\nSail Order on March 14 to\nprevent, among other things, new passengers from boarding cruise ships. CDC\nextended its No Sail Order, effective April 15, 2020, to continue to suspend\nall cruise ship operations in waters subject to US jurisdiction. Among other\nthings, cruise lines are required to develop comprehensive plans to prevent,\ndetect, respond to, and contain COVID-19 on their cruise ships to protect the\nhealth and safety of both passengers and crew.\nHow long is the No Sail Order in effect?\nThe extended Order is in effect until one of the following occurs:\n\nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services declares that COVID-19 no longer constitutes a public health emergency, or\nThe CDC Director rescinds or modifies the order based on specific public health or other considerations, or\n100 days have passed from April 15, the date the extended order was published in the Federal Register and went into effect. 100 days from April 15 is July 24.\n\nWhy did CDC extend the No Sail Order?\nThe No Sail Order was extended to protect the public, cruise ship passengers,\ncruise ship crews, and other industry workers. By restricting cruise ship\npassenger operations, the Order helps achieve several public health goals:\n\nPrevents further spread of COVID-19 into and within the United States\nPreserves critical federal, state, and local resources that are needed to respond to COVID-19\nPreserves critical healthcare, emergency, and port resources\n\nWhat cruise ships does the No Sail Order cover?\nThe No Sail Order applies to all cruise ships, which it defines as commercial\npassenger ships with the capacity to carry more than 250 people and where an\novernight stay onboard by passengers or crew is anticipated. The Order applies\nto all cruise ships operating, or seeking to operate, in waters subject to US\njurisdiction, including those that have previously voluntarily suspended\noperations. It does not apply to cargo ships.\nWhat does the No Sail Order mean for my upcoming trip?\nPassengers who plan to travel by cruise ship should contact their cruise line\ncompanies directly for further information.\nOn March 17, 2020, CDC issued a Level 3 travel health\nnotice\nwith a clear recommendation to avoid all cruise travel due to ongoing spread\nof COVID-19 and the increased risk of person-to-person spread of infectious\ndiseases on cruise ships. The No Sail Order suspends all cruise ship\noperations in waters subject to US jurisdiction.\nWhat is CDC doing to help cruise ships with crew still on board?\nWe are currently in a phase of the pandemic where it is necessary to implement\nstrict measures to control the spread of COVID-19. Just as the American public\nhas a role to play in practicing social distancing, cruise lines have a role\nto play in properly caring for their crew, including making sure they can\npractice social distancing, isolating them if they are sick, and quarantining\nthem if they have been exposed to COVID-19.\nCDC is committed to the safety and well-being of crew members while onboard\nand as they disembark. CDC is allowing crew members to disembark from cruise\nships in U.S. waters and return home if cruise lines submit a signed\nattestation stating that they\nhave complied with requirements to safely disembark their crew members. Crew\nmembers who remain onboard and want to disembark should contact their cruise\nship or cruise line about meeting CDC requirements for safe disembarkation and\ntransport. A list of disembarkations that CDC has approved is available\nhere.\nCrew members on ships in or intending to be in US waters who have questions\nabout the process for disembarkation or who have concerns about what their\nship is doing to prevent COVID-19 onboard can share their questions or\nconcerns with CDC by sending an email to\neocevent431@cdc.gov.\nCruise ships have medical facilities on board that can provide medical care to\nsick crew members as needed. As part of their cruise ship plans, cruise lines\nshould make sure they have enough medical staff, equipment, supplies, and\nother resources to provide care for sick people on board. They also need a\nplan to transfer sick crew members to a hospital on land if they need medical\ncare that the ship\u2019s medical facility can\u2019t provide.\nCDC and federal partners are monitoring ships with crew only, and we are\nworking with the cruise companies and local and state health departments to\nensure that seriously ill crew members can get medical assistance on land if\nthe ship can\u2019t provide it. CDC remains committed to humanitarian medical\nevacuation for people in need of lifesaving support. Emergency medical\nevacuations do not require CDC approval.\nWhat is CDC doing to help cruise ships with passengers still on board?\nA small number of passengers are still aboard cruise ships in and around US\nwaters. These passengers are awaiting repatriation to their home countries.\nCDC is working with partners as part of the Unified Command, including Coast\nGuard, Customs and Border Protection, port authorities, local and state health\ndepartments, and Department of State, along with cruise lines, to help\nremaining cruise ship passengers get home as quickly and safely as possible.\nThese are cruise ships that had international voyages with U.S. ports, and\ntherefore are under CDC jurisdiction. International voyages without U.S. ports\nof call are not under CDC jurisdiction and not included.\nInternational cruise voyages with U.S. domestic ports of call have been\nsuspended since March 14, 2020, under CDC\u2019s No Sail\nOrder.

When a loved\none dies, it is important for friends and family to be able to share stories\nand memories of the person and how they influenced their lives. Because of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, \u201cstay at home orders,\u201d and limits to\ngatherings have affected the ability of friends and family to come together in\nperson and grieve in typical ways. This is true regardless of whether the\nperson\u2019s death was due to COVID-19 or some other cause.\nFortunately, most people understand that hosting gatherings now could be\ndangerous to those who would want to participate. Family and friends are\nfinding alternate ways to connect, support each other, and grieve after their\nloss. They understand the need to possibly plan for additional memorial\nservices when COVID-19-related restrictions are lifted.\nTake actions to help you cope with the loss of a loved one\nGrief is a universal emotion, but no two people experience grief in exactly\nthe same way. Some actions you can take to help you cope with feelings of\ngrief while practicing social distancing and honoring your loved one include:\n\nInvite people to call you, or host conference calls with family members and friends to stay connected.\nAsk family and friends to share stories and pictures with you via phone, video chat, email, text message, photo sharing apps, social media, or mailed letters.\nCreate a virtual memory book, blog, or webpage to remember your loved one, and ask family and friends to contribute their memories and stories.\nCoordinate a date and time for family and friends to honor your loved one by reciting a selected poem, spiritual reading, or prayer from within their own households. Some cultures practice a prolonged mourning period with multiple observances, so hosting virtual events now and in-person events later may be in keeping with these practices.\nSeek spiritual support from faith-based organizations, including religious leaders and congregations, if applicable. People who are not part of a faith tradition or religious community can seek support from other trusted community leaders and friends.\nUse grief counseling services, support groups, or hotlines, especially those that can be offered over the phone or online, or seek support from a mental healthcare provider.\nRead books about grief and loss. If you have children, read age-appropriate books with them and talk with them about how they are feeling.\nTake part in an activity that has significance to you and the loved one you have lost, such as planting flowers or a tree or preparing a favorite meal, in memory of your loved one.\nReview additional information from CDC on loss and grief, and ways to cope with stress and anxiety.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the family and close friends of a person who\ndied of COVID-19 may experience stigma, such as people avoiding them or\nrejecting them.

When a loved\none dies, it is important for friends and family to be able to share stories\nand memories of the person and how they influenced their lives. Because of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, \u201cstay at home orders,\u201d and limits to\ngatherings have affected the ability of friends and family to come together in\nperson and grieve in typical ways. This is true regardless of whether the\nperson\u2019s death was due to COVID-19 or some other cause.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, most people understand that hosting gatherings now could be\ndangerous to those who would want to participate. Family and friends are\nfinding alternate ways to connect, support each other, and grieve after their\nloss. They understand the need to possibly plan for additional memorial\nservices when COVID-19-related restrictions are lifted.</p>\n<h3>Take actions to help you cope with the loss of a loved one</h3>\n<p>Grief is a universal emotion, but no two people experience grief in exactly\nthe same way. Some actions you can take to help you cope with feelings of\ngrief while practicing social distancing and honoring your loved one include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Invite people to call you, or host conference calls with family members and friends to stay connected.</li>\n<li>Ask family and friends to share stories and pictures with you via phone, video chat, email, text message, photo sharing apps, social media, or mailed letters.</li>\n<li>Create a virtual memory book, blog, or webpage to remember your loved one, and ask family and friends to contribute their memories and stories.</li>\n<li>Coordinate a date and time for family and friends to honor your loved one by reciting a selected poem, spiritual reading, or prayer from within their own households. Some cultures practice a prolonged mourning period with multiple observances, so hosting virtual events now and in-person events later may be in keeping with these practices.</li>\n<li>Seek spiritual support from faith-based organizations, including religious leaders and congregations, if applicable. People who are not part of a faith tradition or religious community can seek support from other trusted community leaders and friends.</li>\n<li>Use grief counseling services, support groups, or <a href=\"https://www.samhsa.gov/disaster-preparedness\">hotlines</a>, especially those that can be offered over the phone or online, or seek support from a mental healthcare provider.</li>\n<li>Read books about grief and loss. If you have children, read age-appropriate books with them and talk with them about how they are feeling.</li>\n<li>Take part in an activity that has significance to you and the loved one you have lost, such as planting flowers or a tree or preparing a favorite meal, in memory of your loved one.</li>\n<li>Review additional information from CDC on loss and grief, and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html\">ways to cope with stress and anxiety</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the family and close friends of a person who\ndied of COVID-19 may experience stigma, such as people avoiding them or\nrejecting them.

You should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments.\nFollow CDC recommended precautions and notify your supervisor if you are well but have a sick family member at home with COVID-19.\nLimit close contact with others and maintain a distance of at least 6 feet, when possible. \nRemind customers to maintain 6 feet distance from workers and other customers with verbal announcements on the loudspeaker and written signage.\n\n\nCDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. Cloth face coverings may prevent people who don\u2019t know they have the virus from transmitting it to others. These face coverings are not surgical masks or respirators and are not appropriate substitutes for them in workplaces where masks or respirators are recommended or required.\nEncourage customers to use touchless payment options, when available. Minimize handling cash, credit cards, reward cards, and mobile devices, where possible.\nWhen exchanging paper and coin money: \nDo not touch your face afterward.\nAsk customers to place cash on the counter rather than directly into your hand.\nPlace money directly on the counter when providing change back to customers.\nWipe counter between each customer at checkout.\n\n\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as workstations, cash registers, payment terminals, door handles, tables, and countertops on a routine basis. Follow the directions on the cleaning product\u2019s label and clean hands afterwards.\nPractice proper hand hygiene. This is an important infection control measure. With appropriate hand hygiene, gloves are not necessary for workers who are not involved in food preparation. Wash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. An alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol can be used, but not as a substitute for cleaning hands with soap and water.\nKey times to clean hands include: \nBefore, during, and after preparing food\nBefore eating food\nAfter using the toilet\nAfter blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing\nAfter putting on, touching, or removing cloth face coverings\n\n\nAdditional workplace-specific times to clean hands include: \nBefore and after work shifts and periodically throughout shift\nBefore and after work breaks\nAfter touching money or objects that have been handled by customers, such as reusable grocery bags\nBefore putting on and taking off disposable gloves when performing food prep\n\n\nAvoid contact with body fluids.\nDo not touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.\nUse tissues when you cough, sneeze, or touch your face.

No fit testing or seal check is necessary with facemasks. Most facemasks do not effectively filter small particles from the air and do not prevent leakage around the edge of the mask when the user inhales.</li>\n<li>The role of facemasks is for patient source control, to prevent contamination of the surrounding area when a person coughs or sneezes. Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear a facemask until they are isolated in a hospital or at home. The patient does not need to wear a facemask while isolated.</li>\n</ul>"

Try meditating, relaxation breathing, and progressive muscle relaxation.\nBefore you begin working a long stretch of shifts, try \u201cbanking your sleep\u201d \u2013 sleeping several extra hours longer than you normally do.\nAfter you\u2019ve worked a long stretch of shifts, remember it may take several days of extended sleep (for example, 10 hours in bed) before you begin to feel recovered.
