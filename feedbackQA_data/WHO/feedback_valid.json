The serial interval for\nCOVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the\nserial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than\nCOVID-19.  \nFurther, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-\nsymptomatic transmission \u2013transmission of the virus before the appearance of\nsymptoms \u2013 is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while\nwe are learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours\nprior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver\nof transmission.  \nThe reproductive number \u2013 the number of secondary infections generated from\none infected individual \u2013 is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19\nvirus, higher than for influenza.

For COVID-19, our current understanding is that older\nage and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection.  \nMortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal\ninfluenza.

While we are still learning about how\nCOVID-19 affects people, older persons (e.g. persons over 60 years) and\npersons with pre-existing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, heart\ndisease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes, appear to develop serious illness\nmore often than others. As this is a new virus, we are still learning about\nhow it affects children and adolescents. Evidence to date suggests that\nchildren and adolescents are less likely to get severe disease, but severe\ncases and death can still happen in these age groups.  </p>\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/key-\nmessages-and-actions-for-covid-19-prevention-and-control-in-schools-\nmarch-2020.pdf?sfvrsn=baf81d52_4\">https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/key-messages-and-\nactions-for-covid-19-prevention-and-control-in-schools-\nmarch-2020.pdf?sfvrsn=baf81d52_4</a>  </p>\n<p><a href=\"/news-room/q-a-\ndetail/q-a-coronaviruses\">https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses</a></p>"
