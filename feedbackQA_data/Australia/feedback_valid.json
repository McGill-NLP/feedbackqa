Detailed information on\nhow to save energy is available for\nhouseholds and\nbusinesses.\nHeating and cooling\n\nAround 40% of home energy use can go on heating and cooling. Close off rooms not in use. Set your heating between 18\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C and your cooling between 25\u00b0C and 27\u00b0C.\nFor every degree you increase heating and cooling, you increase energy use between 5% and 10%.\nDress comfortably. You may need to look professional from the waist up for virtual meetings, but working from home means you can dress for the season.\n\nComputers\n\nSet your monitor to switch off/sleep after 10 minutes of inactivity.\nReduce screen brightness to the lowest, visibly comfortable setting.\nSwitch off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when you\u2019re not using them as they use a substantial amount of power by constantly searching for a signal.\nClose any applications you\u2019re not using.\nEnsure air vents on computer towers and laptops are kept clear and away from objects.\nDon\u2019t use active or animated screensavers.\nUnplug any USB devices (like mice, keyboards, speakers and flash drives) when not in use.\nSwitch off when you\u2019ve finished using your device, or set a timer.\nIf purchasing new equipment, look for the Energy Rating Label on all computer monitors\u2014the more stars the better.\nLaptops, ultrabooks and notebooks use less energy than desktop computers and can be battery-operated for extended periods.\n\nMobile phones\n\nSwitch off chargers at the wall once charging is complete, and avoid charging overnight if you can. \nReduce screen brightness and turn off live (animated) wallpapers to reduce battery drain.\nSwitch off Bluetooth and GPS when you\u2019re not using them as they use a substantial amount of power by constantly searching for signal.\nUse aeroplane mode where applicable.\nShorten the amount of time for the screen to turn off automatically\u2014try 30 seconds.\nDelete unwanted apps. The more applications your smartphone has, the faster the power will drain.\nSet your notification alerts to check at 30 minute intervals (or longer) and close applications when you don\u2019t need them. This can also make a big difference to your data usage.\n\nOffice equipment\n\nTurn off your printer, copier, scanner and multi-function devices when you're not using them.\n\u2018Think before you print\u2019 and opt for a printer that prints on both sides of the paper\u2014saving both time and resources.\n",
