This approach, which reflects the\ncomplexity and scale of the DfE’s commercial arrangements, is intended to\nprovide you with some overarching guidance and principles as to how you could\nchoose to implement the PPN.\n\nstage 1: Assessment of whether the supplier has considered other measures announced by the government: This involves asking if they have explored and applied for, as applicable, all other forms of support available to them, including the wider government business support schemes. This is to avoid duplication of funding, such as providing both supplier relief under PPN 02/20 and payment of related workers that have been furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS)\nstage 2: Assessment of whether they are a critical supplier to your organisation: The main consideration here is whether you feel the supplier provides services, goods or works that are critical in the medium and long term, and are important to business continuity to provide relief against the contract\nstage 3: Assessment of whether the supplier is financially ‘at risk’ as a result of COVID-19: In principle, a supplier is deemed at risk where they are unable to fulfil the contractual obligations of a contract due to COVID-19 and are experiencing financial difficulties as a result\nstage 4: Commercial interventions to manage supplier: It is important that commercial judgement is used when considering the type of support available pursuant to the PPN, which could include: \npayments for previously anticipated volumes (even if not met), or for the advanced order of materials where appropriate\ncontinuing to pay for services to suppliers who give their best endeavours to continue delivery despite performance being somewhat affected\nconsidering an extension of time for contract performance (for example, revised milestones or delivery dates)\nadjusting agreed lead times which despite best endeavours might not be met by suppliers and ensure their payments are not negatively affected by that\nconsider supplementing service delivery through your own resources, though this is likely to be difficult, but may help alleviate the challenges the supplier is suffering as a result of COVID-19\n\n\nstage 5: Financial interventions: As with the commercial interventions, financial judgement should be used when considering any of the suggested options below: \nvariation of payment mechanism - specifically beneficial where contracts are based upon the delivery of outcomes or outputs, you can vary the payment mechanisms to provide greater short term cash flow to the supplier, for example, moving from payments on delivery of services, works or goods to aligning payments to the costs being incurred by the supplier, or breaking down milestone payments into multiple smaller payments\nincreasing speed of payment - this PPN seeks to expedite this process and adjust normal financial controls, such as paying reconciled invoices before their due date\nprepayment of up to 25% of contract value - this specifically targets immediate cash flow issues, but potentially creates a cash flow issue at a later date in the contract, so should be considered accordingly. For example, releasing a proportion of retained funds on capital projects, ahead of actual defects being identified and remedied\n\n\n\nIt is important that any commercial or financial changes or variations to\ncontracts should be agreed in accordance with the change control clauses\ncontained in the contracts, and documented, even if this takes place\nretrospectively. The Cabinet Office has developed a series of model clauses\npertaining to\nCOVID-19.\nThere are a number of other important points to note when considering how best\nto implement PPN 02/20 for your organisation:\n\nwhatever approach you decide best meets your needs, you need to ensure you apply the necessary financial and governance controls applicable to your organisation\nthe PPN is very clear about the importance of transparency, and suppliers agreeing to act on an open book basis and make cost data available to you during this period, so please ensure they do so where relevant\nkeeping a record of your agreed approach and supporting rationale, along with details of any payments made, assessment of risks or contractual changes, is important to show that you have an audit trail. This needs to be maintained throughout the period the PPN applies and retained afterwards for any future audit purposes.\n\n[DfE]: Department for Education\n  [PPN]: Procurement Policy Notice",

This is to avoid duplication of funding, such as providing both supplier relief under PPN 02/20 and payment of related workers that have been furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS)</li>\n<li>stage 2: Assessment of whether they are a critical supplier to your organisation: The main consideration here is whether you feel the supplier provides services, goods or works that are critical in the medium and long term, and are important to business continuity to provide relief against the contract</li>\n<li>stage 3: Assessment of whether the supplier is financially ‘at risk’ as a result of COVID-19: In principle, a supplier is deemed at risk where they are unable to fulfil the contractual obligations of a contract due to COVID-19 and are experiencing financial difficulties as a result</li>\n<li>stage 4: Commercial interventions to manage supplier: It is important that commercial judgement is used when considering the type of support available pursuant to the PPN, which could include: <ul>\n<li>payments for previously anticipated volumes (even if not met), or for the advanced order of materials where appropriate</li>\n<li>continuing to pay for services to suppliers who give their best endeavours to continue delivery despite performance being somewhat affected</li>\n<li>considering an extension of time for contract performance (for example, revised milestones or delivery dates)</li>\n<li>adjusting agreed lead times which despite best endeavours might not be met by suppliers and ensure their payments are not negatively affected by that</li>\n<li>consider supplementing service delivery through your own resources, though this is likely to be difficult, but may help alleviate the challenges the supplier is suffering as a result of COVID-19</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>stage 5: Financial interventions: As with the commercial interventions, financial judgement should be used when considering any of the suggested options below: <ul>\n<li>variation of payment mechanism - specifically beneficial where contracts are based upon the delivery of outcomes or outputs, you can vary the payment mechanisms to provide greater short term cash flow to the supplier, for example, moving from payments on delivery of services, works or goods to aligning payments to the costs being incurred by the supplier, or breaking down milestone payments into multiple smaller payments</li>\n<li>increasing speed of payment - this PPN seeks to expedite this process and adjust normal financial controls, such as paying reconciled invoices before their due date</li>\n<li>prepayment of up to 25% of contract value - this specifically targets immediate cash flow issues, but potentially creates a cash flow issue at a later date in the contract, so should be considered accordingly. For example, releasing a proportion of retained funds on capital projects, ahead of actual defects being identified and remedied</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important that any commercial or financial changes or variations to\ncontracts should be agreed in accordance with the change control clauses\ncontained in the contracts, and documented, even if this takes place\nretrospectively. The Cabinet Office has developed <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/procurement-policy-\nnote-0220-supplier-relief-due-to-covid-19\">a series of model clauses\npertaining to\nCOVID-19</a>.</p>\n<p>There are a number of other important points to note when considering how best\nto implement PPN 02/20 for your organisation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>whatever approach you decide best meets your needs, you need to ensure you apply the necessary financial and governance controls applicable to your organisation</li>\n<li>the PPN is very clear about the importance of transparency, and suppliers agreeing to act on an open book basis and make cost data available to you during this period, so please ensure they do so where relevant</li>\n<li>keeping a record of your agreed approach and supporting rationale, along with details of any payments made, assessment of risks or contractual changes, is important to show that you have an audit trail. This needs to be maintained throughout the period the PPN applies and retained afterwards for any future audit purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>[DfE]: Department for Education\n  </em>[PPN]: Procurement Policy Notice</p>"

In the context of COVID-19 this means working\nthrough these steps in order:\n\n\nIn every workplace, increasing the frequency of handwashing and surface cleaning.\n\n\nBusinesses and workplaces should make every reasonable effort to enable working from home as a first option. Where working from home is not possible, workplaces should make every reasonable effort to comply with the social distancing guidelines set out by the government (keeping people 2m apart wherever possible).\n\n\nWhere the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full, in relation to a particular activity, businesses should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business to operate, and, if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between their staff.\n\n\nFurther mitigating actions include:   \n\n\n– increasing the frequency of hand washing and surface cleaning\n– keeping the activity time involved as short as possible\n– using screens or barriers to separate people from each other\n– using back-to-back or side-to-side working (rather than face-to-face)\nwhenever possible\n– reducing the number of people each person has contact with by using ‘fixed\nteams or partnering’ (so each person works with only a few others)\n\n\nFinally, if people must work face-to-face for a sustained period with more than a small group of fixed partners, then you will need to assess whether the activity can safely go ahead. No one is obliged to work in an unsafe work environment.\n\n\nIn your assessment you should have particular regard to whether the people doing the work are especially vulnerable to COVID-19.\n\n\nThe recommendations in the rest of this document are ones you should consider\nas you go through this process. You could also consider any advice that has\nbeen produced specifically for your sector, for example by trade associations\nor trades unions.\nIf you have not already done so, you should carry out an assessment of the\nrisks posed by COVID-19 in your workplace as soon as possible. If you are\ncurrently operating, you are likely to have gone through a lot of this\nthinking already. We recommend that you use this document to identify any\nfurther improvements you should make.\nSteps that will usually be needed when working in homes:\n\n\nNo work should be carried out in a household which is isolating because one or more family members has symptoms or where an individual has been advised to shield - unless it is to remedy a direct risk to the safety of the household.\n\n\nWhen working in a household where somebody is clinically vulnerable, but has not been asked to shield, for example, the home of someone over 70, prior arrangements should be made with vulnerable people to avoid any face-to-face contact, for example, when answering the door. You should be particularly strict about handwashing, coughing and sneezing hygiene, such as covering your nose and mouth and disposing of single-use tissues.\n\n\nStaying updated with the latest guidance and considering how it can be applied to your work. This can include:   \n\n\n– washing your hands more often than usual for 20 seconds using soap and hot\nwater, particularly after coughing, sneezing and blowing your nose  \n– reducing the spread of germs when you cough or sneeze by covering your mouth\nand nose with a tissue, or your sleeve (not your hands) if you don’t have a\ntissue and throw the tissue in a bin immediately, then wash your hands  \n– cleaning regularly touched objects and surfaces using your regular cleaning\nproducts to reduce the risk of passing the infection on to other people  \n– communicating with households prior to any visit to discuss how the work\nwill be carried out to minimise risk for all parties  \n– maintaining social distance as far as possible\n*[COVID-19]: coronavirus",

Where working from home is not possible, workplaces should make every reasonable effort to comply with the social distancing guidelines set out by the government (keeping people 2m apart wherever possible).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full, in relation to a particular activity, businesses should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business to operate, and, if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between their staff.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Further mitigating actions include:   </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>– increasing the frequency of hand washing and surface cleaning<br />\n– keeping the activity time involved as short as possible<br />\n– using screens or barriers to separate people from each other<br />\n– using back-to-back or side-to-side working (rather than face-to-face)\nwhenever possible<br />\n– reducing the number of people each person has contact with by using ‘fixed\nteams or partnering’ (so each person works with only a few others)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, if people must work face-to-face for a sustained period with more than a small group of fixed partners, then you will need to assess whether the activity can safely go ahead. No one is obliged to work in an unsafe work environment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In your assessment you should have particular regard to whether the people doing the work are especially vulnerable to COVID-19.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The recommendations in the rest of this document are ones you should consider\nas you go through this process. You could also consider any advice that has\nbeen produced specifically for your sector, for example by trade associations\nor trades unions.</p>\n<p>If you have not already done so, you should carry out an assessment of the\nrisks posed by COVID-19 in your workplace as soon as possible. If you are\ncurrently operating, you are likely to have gone through a lot of this\nthinking already. We recommend that you use this document to identify any\nfurther improvements you should make.</p>\n<p><strong>Steps that will usually be needed when working in homes:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>No work should be carried out in a household which is isolating because one or more family members has symptoms or where an individual has been advised to shield - unless it is to remedy a direct risk to the safety of the household.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When working in a household where somebody is clinically vulnerable, but has not been asked to shield, for example, the home of someone over 70, prior arrangements should be made with vulnerable people to avoid any face-to-face contact, for example, when answering the door. You should be particularly strict about handwashing, coughing and sneezing hygiene, such as covering your nose and mouth and disposing of single-use tissues.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Staying updated with the latest guidance and considering how it can be applied to your work. This can include:   </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>– washing your hands more often than usual for 20 seconds using soap and hot\nwater, particularly after coughing, sneezing and blowing your nose  </p>\n<p>– reducing the spread of germs when you cough or sneeze by covering your mouth\nand nose with a tissue, or your sleeve (not your hands) if you don’t have a\ntissue and throw the tissue in a bin immediately, then wash your hands  </p>\n<p>– cleaning regularly touched objects and surfaces using your regular cleaning\nproducts to reduce the risk of passing the infection on to other people  </p>\n<p>– communicating with households prior to any visit to discuss how the work\nwill be carried out to minimise risk for all parties  </p>\n<p>– maintaining social distance as far as possible</p>\n<p>*[COVID-19]: coronavirus</p>"

These learners can be included in on-site delivery if they would benefit from face to face contact;\nwe will be expecting colleges and providers to treat 16 to 19-year-old apprentices consistently with other learners for their off the job training where possible and appropriate, so that they can be offered some face to face contact;\nin addition to colleges, this guidance also applies to the smaller proportion of 16 to 19 learners in other further education settings – including Local Authority delivery, Special Post-16 Designated Institutions and independent providers\n\nIn order to determine what level of attendance is appropriate within any of\nthe options stated above, colleges and other providers should conduct risk\nassessments in order to understand:\n\nthe number of learners and staff likely to be included in a learning space\nwhether they can be safely accommodated in accordance with guidance to implement protective measures\nthe availability of teaching and non-teaching staff and required ratios, including contingency plans should individuals be shielding or self-isolating\nsupporting services required in increasing the number of individuals on-site (for example, catering) and how they can be safely provided\nwhat measures in addition to those that have already been undertaken during the current lockdown will need to be in place to accommodate additional numbers (including additional cleaning required of spaces and equipment following use)\n\nLearners will need to stay within their new class/group wherever possible and\nwe will ask settings to implement a range of protective\nmeasures\nincluding increased cleaning, reducing ‘pinch points’ (such as at the start\nand end of day), and utilising outdoor space. Any additional costs arising\nfrom wider opening, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) will be funded\nfrom existing college budgets. Staff and learners will be eligible for testing\nif they become ill with coronavirus symptoms, as will members of their\nhouseholds. A negative test will enable learners and staff to get back to\ntheir education. A positive test will ensure rapid action to protect their\nclassmates and staff in their setting. Those who are clinically vulnerable, or\nare living with someone who is, should follow our protective measures\nguidance.\nIn line with implementing protective measures and reducing contacts, colleges\nand other providers should limit the attendance of learners in the setting at\nany one time and keep learners in small groups.

This might include children on the edge of receiving support from children’s social care services, adopted children, those at risk of becoming NEET (‘not in employment, education or training’), those living in temporary accommodation, those who are young carers and others at the provider and local authority’s discretion.\n\nMore information, including the expectations around attendance and encouraging\nattendance for different groups of vulnerable young people, can be found in\nSupporting vulnerable children and young people during the coronavirus\n(COVID-19) outbreak.\nFrom the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, we will be asking colleges\nand other providers to invite increasing numbers of young people to return to\non-site provision, alongside priority groups (vulnerable young people and\nchildren of critical workers). Special post-16 institutions will work towards\na phased return of more young people without a focus on specific year groups.\nThe government has set out guidance on staying alert and safe (social\ndistancing) to help educational settings support safe provision\nfor everyone who attends.\nMany colleges and other providers have already taken steps to support\nvulnerable young people, and the children of critical workers who cannot be\nsupported elsewhere, and we are grateful to providers for the vital role they\nare playing in supporting the national response to coronavirus.\nSpecifically, we are asking that colleges and other providers:\n\n\ncontinue to provide a safe space and encourage attendance: Being in an educational setting can be an important lifeline for many vulnerable young people, particularly where their needs cannot be met safely at home or where they may be at risk of harm.\n\n\nThere is a continuing expectation now and throughout the period from the week commencing 1 June at the earliest that vulnerable young people – regardless of year group – will attend educational provision, where it is safe and appropriate for them do so.\n\n\nFrom the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, young people in returning year groups – including vulnerable young people - are strongly encouraged to attend their educational setting where possible, unless they are ill, or guidance says they should not attend.\n\n\nProviders are expected to follow the process set out on encouraging, enabling and monitoring attendance and following up on non-attendance, see Supporting vulnerable children and young people during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.\n\n\nWe appreciate that decisions on attendance will likely be based on finely balanced discussions between the education provider, the parent/carer and others, including social workers, local authorities and other relevant professionals where applicable. The decision might be taken that the learner should attend the educational setting on a full-time or part-time basis, depending on the needs of the individual. We also appreciate that circumstances do change and therefore attendance decisions should be kept under review. For young people with an education, health and care (EHC) plan, colleges and other providers should ensure that existing risk assessments are up to date. \n\nWhere vulnerable young people are already attending educational settings, they should continue to do so. Where young people are currently not attending but attendance is appropriate, we expect providers and local authorities to consider how to encourage their attendance.\nIf it is not possible for a vulnerable young person to attend a provider due to public transport routes being closed, then providers should speak to the local authority to consider what alternative transport arrangements could be put in place.\n\n\nMake alternative arrangements: We are asking colleges and other providers that have been closed to work towards wider opening from the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, so we expect the number of colleges and other providers that are closed to decline. However, in the meantime if a college or another provider is closed, the provider should notify the local authority/social worker. Providers should work with the local authority to ensure that the vulnerable young people who normally attend can be found a place in another educational setting. Providers can also contact their local ESFA team to discuss wider opening and which other local providers it may be possible for them to work with.\nKeep in contact with all vulnerable learners: As per the existing guidance on vulnerable children and young people, all vulnerable young people continue to be expected and encouraged to attend educational provision where it is appropriate for them to do so. Colleges and other providers which are currently closed are being asked to work towards wider opening from the week commencing 1 June at the earliest.\nHowever, where it is not safe for vulnerable learners to attend, or vulnerable learners cannot be persuaded to attend education settings, colleges and other providers should maintain regular communication with social workers, vulnerable leaners and their families to ensure they know where their vulnerable learners are and that they are safe. Colleges and other providers should continue to encourage attendance where appropriate. The frequency of contact required will depend on the individual’s circumstances and needs and will be based on the assessment of risk. Social workers will remain in contact with vulnerable learners and their families, including remotely if needed.\n\nSection 15 below is a collection of examples from providers who are\nsuccessfully engaging vulnerable young people. It is intended to provide an\nopportunity for colleges and other providers to learn from each other’s\nemerging practice and develop their approach to engaging vulnerable learners\nin education.\nColleges and other providers should continue to comply with the Keeping\nchildren safe in education statutory\nguidance.

This might include children on the edge of receiving support from children’s social care services, adopted children, those at risk of becoming NEET (‘not in employment, education or training’), those living in temporary accommodation, those who are young carers and others at the provider and local authority’s discretion.\n\nMore information, including the expectations around attendance and encouraging\nattendance for different groups of vulnerable young people, can be found in\nSupporting vulnerable children and young people during the coronavirus\n(COVID-19) outbreak.\nFrom the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, we will be asking colleges\nand other providers to invite increasing numbers of young people to return to\non-site provision, alongside priority groups (vulnerable young people and\nchildren of critical workers). Special post-16 institutions will work towards\na phased return of more young people without a focus on specific year groups.\nThe government has set out guidance on staying alert and safe (social\ndistancing) to help educational settings support safe provision\nfor everyone who attends.\nMany colleges and other providers have already taken steps to support\nvulnerable young people, and the children of critical workers who cannot be\nsupported elsewhere, and we are grateful to providers for the vital role they\nare playing in supporting the national response to coronavirus.\nSpecifically, we are asking that colleges and other providers:\n\n\ncontinue to provide a safe space and encourage attendance: Being in an educational setting can be an important lifeline for many vulnerable young people, particularly where their needs cannot be met safely at home or where they may be at risk of harm.\n\n\nThere is a continuing expectation now and throughout the period from the week commencing 1 June at the earliest that vulnerable young people – regardless of year group – will attend educational provision, where it is safe and appropriate for them do so.\n\n\nFrom the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, young people in returning year groups – including vulnerable young people - are strongly encouraged to attend their educational setting where possible, unless they are ill, or guidance says they should not attend.\n\n\nProviders are expected to follow the process set out on encouraging, enabling and monitoring attendance and following up on non-attendance, see Supporting vulnerable children and young people during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.\n\n\nWe appreciate that decisions on attendance will likely be based on finely balanced discussions between the education provider, the parent/carer and others, including social workers, local authorities and other relevant professionals where applicable. The decision might be taken that the learner should attend the educational setting on a full-time or part-time basis, depending on the needs of the individual. We also appreciate that circumstances do change and therefore attendance decisions should be kept under review. For young people with an education, health and care (EHC) plan, colleges and other providers should ensure that existing risk assessments are up to date. \n\nWhere vulnerable young people are already attending educational settings, they should continue to do so. Where young people are currently not attending but attendance is appropriate, we expect providers and local authorities to consider how to encourage their attendance.\nIf it is not possible for a vulnerable young person to attend a provider due to public transport routes being closed, then providers should speak to the local authority to consider what alternative transport arrangements could be put in place.\n\n\nMake alternative arrangements: We are asking colleges and other providers that have been closed to work towards wider opening from the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, so we expect the number of colleges and other providers that are closed to decline. However, in the meantime if a college or another provider is closed, the provider should notify the local authority/social worker. Providers should work with the local authority to ensure that the vulnerable young people who normally attend can be found a place in another educational setting. Providers can also contact their local ESFA team to discuss wider opening and which other local providers it may be possible for them to work with.\nKeep in contact with all vulnerable learners: As per the existing guidance on vulnerable children and young people, all vulnerable young people continue to be expected and encouraged to attend educational provision where it is appropriate for them to do so. Colleges and other providers which are currently closed are being asked to work towards wider opening from the week commencing 1 June at the earliest.\nHowever, where it is not safe for vulnerable learners to attend, or vulnerable learners cannot be persuaded to attend education settings, colleges and other providers should maintain regular communication with social workers, vulnerable leaners and their families to ensure they know where their vulnerable learners are and that they are safe. Colleges and other providers should continue to encourage attendance where appropriate. The frequency of contact required will depend on the individual’s circumstances and needs and will be based on the assessment of risk. Social workers will remain in contact with vulnerable learners and their families, including remotely if needed.\n\nSection 15 below is a collection of examples from providers who are\nsuccessfully engaging vulnerable young people.

Where possible, colleges and other providers should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Prepare staff on remote learning practice through bitesize/refresher training sessions focused on how to use college virtual learning environments (VLEs), communication tools and digital and non-digital resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use tools already available at your college including physical and digital resources, and how to make use of cloud storage systems (for example, Office 365 or Google G Suite). Ensure staff and students have log-in details and know how to access online content.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide students with accessible guides on remote learning, focusing on where, when and how they are expected to engage and demonstrate their learning and how assessment and feedback will be delivered. Consider how to support disadvantaged learners.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consider provision for partnership working with the relevant agencies (including Health and Social Care) to help ensure support for vulnerable children and children with special educational needs and disabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consider how you will deploy your staff to ensure safeguarding, Prevent and security policies are maintained. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/home-working\">provides guidance</a> on how to work from home while adhering to these policies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consider lesson capture to allow students to dip in and out of lessons at their own pace.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be sensitive and adaptive to the wellbeing and wellness of both students and teachers, recognising that health and caring responsibilities will disrupt the teaching delivery and learning journey for individuals during the closure period. Jisc has produced a guide to the Digital Wellbeing of Learners which curates a number of resources and guides.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We understand that what providers can offer during this period will vary. Some\ncolleges and FE providers have shifted much of their provision online and are\ndelivering classes and other teacher led activity to a regular timetable. This\nis excellent practice if it can be reasonably maintained.</p>\n<p>The local ESFA teams will also provide support and you can submit enquiries\nthrough the ESFA enquiries service.</p>\n<p>Richard Atkins, the FE Commissioner (FEC), and his team of highly experienced\ndeputy FECs and FE advisers have offered their services to college leaders\nthat would like to talk through plans, concerns and issues. Our pool of\nNational Leaders of Governance (NLGs) also stand ready to offer any support\nthey can. If you would like to arrange a phone conversation between yourself\nand a member of the FEC team or a NLG, email\n<a href=\"mailto:FEC.OPERATIONS@education.gov.uk\">FEC.OPERATIONS@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>\n<p>We continue to collect examples of good practice and will share these through\nour usual communications channels.</p>\n<p><em>[FE]: further education\n  </em>[DfE]: Department for Education\n  <em>[ETF]: Education and Training Foundation\n  </em>[VLEs]: virtual learning environments\n  <em>[NCSC]: National Cyber Security Centre\n  </em>[ESFA]: Education Skills Funding Agency\n  <em>[FEC]: further education commissioner\n  </em>[NLGs]: National Leaders of Governance\n  *[NLG]: National Leader of Governance</p>"

People who have successfully completed a period of staying at home have kept themselves busy with activities such as cooking, reading, online learning and watching films\nmany people find it helpful to plan out the full 14 days, such as on a make-shift calendar. You may also find it helpful to plan in advance what you will do if, for example, someone in the household were to feel much worse, such as have difficulties breathing\nwhen you are feeling better, remember that physical exercise can be good for your wellbeing.

Staying at home will\nhelp control the spread of the virus to friends, the wider community, and\nparticularly the most vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Those with symptoms should remain at home for at least 7 days after the onset\nof their symptoms as set out in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-\nguidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-\ncovid-19-infection#ending-isolation\">stay-at-home\nguidance</a>. This will reduce the risk of you\ninfecting others.</p>\n<p>If one of you has symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, then household\nmembers must also stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days as set out\nin the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-\nguidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-\ncovid-19-infection#ending-isolation\">stay-at-home\nguidance</a> and the ending household isolation\nsection below. You should not go out even to buy food or other essentials\nunless you have no other means to secure them, and any exercise should be\ntaken within your home. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first\nperson in your house became ill.</p>\n<p>If you are having food or other essentials delivered to your house, the person\nwho is delivering the items should not come into your home. Staying at home\nfor 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household\ncould pass on to others in the community.</p>\n<p>Staying at home may be difficult and frustrating, but there are things that\nyou can do to help make it easier. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>plan ahead and think about what you will need in order to be able to stay at home for the full 7 or 14 days</li>\n<li>talk to your employer, friends and family to ask for their help to access the things you will need to make your stay at home a success</li>\n<li>think about and plan how you can get access to food and other supplies such as medications that you will need during this period</li>\n<li>ask friends or family to drop off anything you need or order supplies online, but make sure these are left outside your home for you to collect</li>\n<li>make sure that you keep in touch with friends and family over the phone or through social media</li>\n<li>think about things you can do during your time at home. People who have successfully completed a period of staying at home have kept themselves busy with activities such as cooking, reading, online learning and watching films</li>\n<li>many people find it helpful to plan out the full 14 days, such as on a make-shift calendar. You may also find it helpful to plan in advance what you will do if, for example, someone in the household were to feel much worse, such as have difficulties breathing</li>\n<li>when you are feeling better, remember that physical exercise can be good for your wellbeing. Look for online classes or courses that can help you take light exercise in your home</li>\n</ul>"

Over time, as restrictions are\nlifted, providers will begin to re-introduce classroom and workshop-based\nlearning. For many learners, this will mean a transition from remote learning\nto blended learning (e.g. a combination of remote and traditional classroom,\nworkshop or workplace learning).\nGiven resources are finite - estate, equipment and staff - the varied needs of\ndifferent learner groups and courses will need to be balanced, providers will\nneed flexibility in deciding the optimal mix of online and face to face\ncontent across their curriculum to maximise learner engagement, support\nvulnerable learners, and enable the provider as a whole to minimise the\ntransmission risk. Providers will also need to take account of learners who\nmay have family members who are shielding and therefore do not wish to\nphysically attend.\nTwo DfE grant funded organisations - Jisc and The Education and Training\nFoundation (ETF) – are well-placed to advise and support colleges and staff\nregarding remote teaching and learning.\nSupport available includes free content, blogs, and community support. The\nETF’s Enhance Digital Learning Platform offers free training to teachers in\nhow to use technology to support the continuity of teaching and learning. ETF\nis also running webinars for FE providers\non how to make the most of online learning.\nProviders’ strategies for ongoing learning should be informed by the needs of\nteachers and students, and their respective home teaching and learning\nenvironments. Where possible, colleges and other providers should:\n\n\nPrepare staff on remote learning practice through bitesize/refresher training sessions focused on how to use college virtual learning environments (VLEs), communication tools and digital and non-digital resources.\n\n\nUse tools already available at your college including physical and digital resources, and how to make use of cloud storage systems (for example, Office 365 or Google G Suite). Ensure staff and students have log-in details and know how to access online content.\n\n\nProvide students with accessible guides on remote learning, focusing on where, when and how they are expected to engage and demonstrate their learning and how assessment and feedback will be delivered. Consider how to support disadvantaged learners.\n\n\nConsider provision for partnership working with the relevant agencies (including Health and Social Care) to help ensure support for vulnerable children and children with special educational needs and disabilities.\n\n\nConsider how you will deploy your staff to ensure safeguarding, Prevent and security policies are maintained. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) provides guidance on how to work from home while adhering to these policies.\n\n\nConsider lesson capture to allow students to dip in and out of lessons at their own pace.\n\n\nBe sensitive and adaptive to the wellbeing and wellness of both students and teachers, recognising that health and caring responsibilities will disrupt the teaching delivery and learning journey for individuals during the closure period. Jisc has produced a guide to the Digital Wellbeing of Learners which curates a number of resources and guides.\n\n\nWe understand that what providers can offer during this period will vary. Some\ncolleges and FE providers have shifted much of their provision online and are\ndelivering classes and other teacher led activity to a regular timetable.

Over time, as restrictions are\nlifted, providers will begin to re-introduce classroom and workshop-based\nlearning. For many learners, this will mean a transition from remote learning\nto blended learning (e.g. a combination of remote and traditional classroom,\nworkshop or workplace learning).</p>\n<p>Given resources are finite - estate, equipment and staff - the varied needs of\ndifferent learner groups and courses will need to be balanced, providers will\nneed flexibility in deciding the optimal mix of online and face to face\ncontent across their curriculum to maximise learner engagement, support\nvulnerable learners, and enable the provider as a whole to minimise the\ntransmission risk. Providers will also need to take account of learners who\nmay have family members who are shielding and therefore do not wish to\nphysically attend.</p>\n<p>Two DfE grant funded organisations - Jisc and The Education and Training\nFoundation (ETF) – are well-placed to advise and support colleges and staff\nregarding remote teaching and learning.</p>\n<p>Support available includes free content, blogs, and community support. The\nETF’s Enhance Digital Learning Platform offers free training to teachers in\nhow to use technology to support the continuity of teaching and learning. ETF\nis also running <a href=\"https://www.et-\nfoundation.co.uk/news/new-series-of-free-webinars-to-support-online-learning/\">webinars for FE providers</a>\non how to make the most of online learning.</p>\n<p>Providers’ strategies for ongoing learning should be informed by the needs of\nteachers and students, and their respective home teaching and learning\nenvironments. Where possible, colleges and other providers should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Prepare staff on remote learning practice through bitesize/refresher training sessions focused on how to use college virtual learning environments (VLEs), communication tools and digital and non-digital resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use tools already available at your college including physical and digital resources, and how to make use of cloud storage systems (for example, Office 365 or Google G Suite). Ensure staff and students have log-in details and know how to access online content.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide students with accessible guides on remote learning, focusing on where, when and how they are expected to engage and demonstrate their learning and how assessment and feedback will be delivered. Consider how to support disadvantaged learners.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consider provision for partnership working with the relevant agencies (including Health and Social Care) to help ensure support for vulnerable children and children with special educational needs and disabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consider how you will deploy your staff to ensure safeguarding, Prevent and security policies are maintained. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/home-working\">provides guidance</a> on how to work from home while adhering to these policies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consider lesson capture to allow students to dip in and out of lessons at their own pace.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be sensitive and adaptive to the wellbeing and wellness of both students and teachers, recognising that health and caring responsibilities will disrupt the teaching delivery and learning journey for individuals during the closure period. Jisc has produced a guide to the Digital Wellbeing of Learners which curates a number of resources and guides.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We understand that what providers can offer during this period will vary.

For example, we could still apply\nthe current approach of identifying what proportion of student numbers were\nrecruited after we take the initial data return in the autumn but use full\nyear data from 2018/19.\nStudent prior attainment in English and/or maths GCSEs\nThree elements within the 16 to 19 funding formula use students’ prior\nattainment in English and/or maths, namely:\n\nthe condition of funding\ndisadvantage funding - block 2\nlevel 3 programme maths and English payment\n\nWe anticipate that these will continue to be calculated as now following the\nalternative plans that have now been published to award grades to students in\nthe absence of GCSE exams this summer, and so providers will still be\nallocated additional funding for young people with low prior attainment in\nGCSE English or maths.

We have\nalready published the approach for applying a tolerance where enrolment of T\nlevel students is below the planned number.\nDue to the lagged student number approach, where the level of T level students\nrecruited means the tolerance would be implemented, only the numbers above the\ntolerance would be converted to a full-time band 5 student. Read more about\nthe tolerance in the How T levels will be funded in 2020 to\n2021 guidance.\nWe will monitor the suitability of this approach over the coming months as we\nget nearer to the introduction of T levels.\nIndustry Placement Capacity and Delivery Fund (CDF) 2019 to 2020\nThe unprecedented impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) has meant that it is\ncurrently extremely difficult for providers to continue to organise and\ndeliver industry placements through the Capacity and Delivery Fund (CDF).\nGiven these exceptional and unprecedented circumstances, providers will not be\npenalised for missing specific CDF industry placement targets this academic\nyear. Funding will not be clawed back if providers can demonstrate how the\nfunding has and will continue to support your work on industry placement\ndelivery. We want to make sure that providers are able to maximise the\nactivity that they are able to carry out during this period to continue to\nsupport the delivery of placements, and to prepare to deliver placements in\n2020 to 2021. Activities we would expect to continue to go ahead:\n\ncontinuing to build relationships with employers and developing engagement strategies for different industries\npreparing students for placements (such as through virtual training for work programmes)\nensuring alignment between curriculum planning and industry placement provision\ndeveloping matching processes for when students can go on placements again\n\nWe will ask for evidence of this through the usual autumn CDF monitoring\nprocess in order to minimise reporting burdens, and we will still look to claw\nback funding under the usual arrangements should providers fail to demonstrate\nthey have continued to support the delivery of industry placements. Providers\nmust avoid the risk of double funding. We will seek to claw back funding\nshould providers furlough staff involved in these activities.\nFree meals in further education\nWe expect further education institutions to continue to support students who\nare eligible for, and usually receive, free meals in further education, or are\nnewly eligible, whether they are continuing to attend the provider or are\nstudying remotely due to coronavirus (COVID-19) related issues.

This critical worker\ndefinition does not affect whether or not you can travel to work - if you are\nnot a critical worker, you may still travel to work if you cannot work from\nhome. However, if you, or a member of your household are unwell with symptoms\nof coronavirus, you should isolate and should not travel to or attend the\nworkplace.\nCritical workers and parents or guardians of vulnerable children may leave\ntheir home to take children to and from school or their childcare provider.\nYou can also attend the funeral of a close family member or member of your\nhousehold (or, of a friend, if no one from their close family or household is\nattending). Religious ministers or leaders can leave their homes to go to\ntheir place of worship, but these should remain closed to the public\nYou may also leave or be outside of your home in order to access other\ncritical public services, such as social services, support provided to\nvictims, services provided by the Department for Work and Pensions, to fulfil\na legal obligation, or to move home in line with the government’s\nguidance.\nA fuller list of the reasons you can leave home is set out in the\nregulations.\nWhen you do need to go out, you should follow the guidelines on staying safe\noutside your home. Most importantly, this includes the key advice that you\nshould stay two metres apart from anyone outside of your household. Face\ncoverings can help us protect each other and reduce the spread of\nthe disease if you are in an enclosed space where social distancing isn’t\npossible and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally\nmeet. This is most relevant for short periods indoors in crowded areas, for\nexample on public transport or in some shops. You should be prepared to remove\nyour face covering if asked to do so by police officers and staff for the\npurposes of identification.\nIt is still not permitted to leave your house to visit friends and family in\ntheir home.
