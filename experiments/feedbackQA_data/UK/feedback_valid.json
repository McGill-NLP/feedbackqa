You are very unlikely to be infected from walking past another\nperson. Public Health England (PHE) recommends trying to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-\nsocial-distancing\">keep 2 metres away\nfrom people, where\npossible</a>, as a precaution. However, this is not a rule and the\nscience is complex. The key thing is to not be too close to people for more\nthan a short amount of time, as much as you can.</p>\n<p>Employers should advise staff and passengers on ways of working to keep their\ndistance from other people as much as possible. There are situations where\nthis may not be possible, for example when boarding or alighting, during\nsecurity checks, on busier services, busier times of day, when walking through\ninterchanges and when undertaking maintenance work that requires two people\nfor the task. Where social distancing is not possible try to minimise the time\nspent within 2 metres of others, and keep groups of workers in teams that are\nas small as possible (\u201ccohorting\u201d). For example, keeping maintenance crews\nworking together, rather than mixing crew members on different shifts.</p>\n<p>Organisations could consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating and agreeing a single, clear approach to social distancing for all workers and passengers.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Agreeing and maintaining clear rules for workers and passengers that meet social distancing guidelines, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clear rules for interacting with passengers, receiving goods, and testing equipment.</li>\n<li>Support individual workers who choose to use face coverings in situations where social distancing is not possible.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Organising the workspace and how people work in a single space to follow social distancing guidelines, such as:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Separating workspaces 2 metres apart from one another, where possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Use of screens or barriers.</li>\n<li>Eliminating face-to-face seating, for example, shift to \u2018bench\u2019 style.</li>\n<li>Repositioning workspaces to allow for optimal ventilation.</li>\n<li>Reducing occupancy of group interaction spaces, including spaces shared with other organisations.</li>\n<li>Adjustments for those with specific needs or protected characteristics, for example disabled people, the elderly and pregnant women. Consider groups of people who process information differently or who may not be able to distance from others.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Workplaces should not encourage the precautionary use of extra personal\nprotective equipment (PPE) to protect against coronavirus outside of clinical\nsettings or when responding to a suspected or confirmed case.</p>\n<p>Where you are already using PPE in your work activity to protect against non-\nCOVID-19 risks, you should continue to do so. When managing the risk of\nCOVID-19, additional PPE beyond what you usually wear is not beneficial. This\nis because COVID-19 is a different type of risk to the risks you normally face\nin a workplace, and needs to be managed through social distancing, hygiene and\nfixed teams or partnering, not through the use of PPE.</p>\n<p>There are some circumstances when wearing a face covering may be marginally\nbeneficial as a precautionary measure. The evidence suggests that wearing a\nface covering does not protect you, but it may protect others if you are\ninfected but have not yet developed symptoms. This is most relevant for short\nperiods indoors in crowded areas.</p>\n<p>Government guidance is for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-\ncovid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers\">passengers, if they can, to wear a face covering\nif they need to use public transport</a>.</p>\n<p>A face covering is not the same as the surgical masks or respirators used by\nhealthcare and other workers as part of personal protective equipment. These\nshould continue to be reserved for those who need them to protect against\nrisks in their workplace, such as health and care workers, and those in\nindustrial settings, like those exposed to dust hazards.</p>\n<p>Wearing a face covering is optional and is not required by the law. If workers\nchoose to wear one, it is important to use face coverings properly and wash\nhands before putting them on and taking them off. Use the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-safe-outside-\nyour-home/staying-safe-outside-your-home#face-coverings\">guidance on face\ncoverings</a>.</p>\n<p>If workers choose to use face coverings, you should support them in using face\ncoverings safely. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser before putting a face covering on, and after removing it.</li>\n<li>When wearing a face covering, avoid touching your face or face covering, as you could contaminate them with germs from your hands.</li>\n<li>Change your face covering if it becomes damp or if you\u2019ve touched it.</li>\n<li>Continue to wash your hands regularly.</li>\n<li>Change and wash your face covering daily.</li>\n<li>If the material is washable, wash in line with manufacturer\u2019s instructions. If it\u2019s not washable, dispose of it in your usual waste.</li>\n<li>Practise social distancing wherever possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>[PHE]: Public Health England\n  </em>[PPE]: personal protective equipment</p>"

A risk assessment is not about creating huge amounts of paperwork,\nbut rather about identifying sensible measures to control the risks in your\nworkplace. If you have fewer than 5 workers, or are self-employed, you don\u2019t\nhave to write anything down as part of your risk assessment. Your risk\nassessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to.\nThe Health and Safety Executive has guidance for business on how to manage\nrisk and risk assessment at work along with specific advice to help control the risk of\ncoronavirus in workplaces.\nEmployers have a duty to consult their people on health and safety. You can do\nthis by listening and talking to them about the work and how you will manage\nrisks from COVID-19. The people who do the work are often the best people to\nunderstand the risks in the workplace and will have a view on how to work\nsafely.

As an employer, you cannot decide who the\nrepresentative will be.\nAt its most effective, full involvement of your workers creates a culture\nwhere relationships between employers and workers are based on collaboration,\ntrust and joint problem solving.

The emergency exemptions cease to apply once the\nsituation is under control and there is no longer a need for immediate\npreventative action.\nThe department would not normally expect drivers in emergencies to:\n\ndrive for more than 11 hours in one day\nhave less than 9 hours of daily rest\nwork for more than 7 days before the start of the regular or reduced weekly rest (if operating under the EU rules), or\nhave less than 24 hours weekly rest\n\nIn addition, drivers operating under the EU drivers\u2019 hours rules should ensure\nthey take a 45 minute break after 4.5 hours driving.\nThe relevant provisions of the Road Transport (Working Time) Regulations\n2005 will not\napply, to the extent that they conflict with the requirements of responding to\nthe emergency. Drivers will, however, remain subject to all other requirements\nof the Working Time Regulations in an emergency event.\nThe practical implementation of any changes should be through agreement\nbetween employers, employees and (where available) driver representatives.\nEmployers must, where possible, agree any extension of working time with\nemployees or other workers, before that work starts.\nThe drivers in question must note on the back of their tachograph charts or\nprintouts the reasons why they are exceeding the normally permitted limits.\nThis is usual practice in emergencies and is, of course, essential for\nenforcement purposes.\nOperators should maintain records of when standard drivers\u2019 hours have been\ndeviated from, along with a justification of why this was needed. The\nresponsibilities of operators, transport managers and the wider supply chain\nmay be examined after the current events. It is important that on subsequent\ninspections and checks it can be clear that a relaxation was used\nappropriately, was well implemented and in a way to reduce fatigue (for\nexample in relation to shift patterns).\n[GB]: Great Britain\n  [EU]: European Union",

The emergency exemptions cease to apply once the\nsituation is under control and there is no longer a need for immediate\npreventative action.</p>\n<p>The department would not normally expect drivers in emergencies to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>drive for more than 11 hours in one day</li>\n<li>have less than 9 hours of daily rest</li>\n<li>work for more than 7 days before the start of the regular or reduced weekly rest (if operating under the EU rules), or</li>\n<li>have less than 24 hours weekly rest</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, drivers operating under the EU drivers\u2019 hours rules should ensure\nthey take a 45 minute break after 4.5 hours driving.</p>\n<p>The relevant provisions of the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/639/contents/made\">Road Transport (Working Time) Regulations\n2005</a> will not\napply, to the extent that they conflict with the requirements of responding to\nthe emergency. Drivers will, however, remain subject to all other requirements\nof the Working Time Regulations in an emergency event.</p>\n<p>The practical implementation of any changes should be through agreement\nbetween employers, employees and (where available) driver representatives.\nEmployers must, where possible, agree any extension of working time with\nemployees or other workers, before that work starts.</p>\n<p>The drivers in question must note on the back of their tachograph charts or\nprintouts the reasons why they are exceeding the normally permitted limits.\nThis is usual practice in emergencies and is, of course, essential for\nenforcement purposes.</p>\n<p>Operators should maintain records of when standard drivers\u2019 hours have been\ndeviated from, along with a justification of why this was needed. The\nresponsibilities of operators, transport managers and the wider supply chain\nmay be examined after the current events. It is important that on subsequent\ninspections and checks it can be clear that a relaxation was used\nappropriately, was well implemented and in a way to reduce fatigue (for\nexample in relation to shift patterns).</p>\n<p><em>[GB]: Great Britain\n  </em>[EU]: European Union</p>"

For providers who\nrecruit learners later in the year rather than purely at the beginning of the\nacademic year, and whose enrolment of new learners in the summer term will\nhave ceased, we will determine a way to ensure this does not have an unfairly\ndetrimental impact on future allocations. For example, we could still apply\nthe current approach of identifying what proportion of student numbers were\nrecruited after we take the initial data return in the autumn but use full\nyear data from 2018/19.\nStudent prior attainment in English and/or maths GCSEs\nThree elements within the 16 to 19 funding formula use students\u2019 prior\nattainment in English and/or maths, namely:\n\nthe condition of funding\ndisadvantage funding - block 2\nlevel 3 programme maths and English payment\n\nWe anticipate that these will continue to be calculated as now following the\nalternative plans that have now been published to award grades to students in\nthe absence of GCSE exams this summer, and so providers will still be\nallocated additional funding for young people with low prior attainment in\nGCSE English or maths. As further details are published for how the\nreplacement for exams will work, we will consider these elements in more\ndetail.\nFunding to prepare for and deliver T levels\nAllocations have been made to providers who will be delivering the first wave\nof T levels in 2020 to 2021 based on planned T level student numbers. We have\nalready published the approach for applying a tolerance where enrolment of T\nlevel students is below the planned number.\nDue to the lagged student number approach, where the level of T level students\nrecruited means the tolerance would be implemented, only the numbers above the\ntolerance would be converted to a full-time band 5 student. Read more about\nthe tolerance in the How T levels will be funded in 2020 to\n2021 guidance.\nWe will monitor the suitability of this approach over the coming months as we\nget nearer to the introduction of T levels.\nIndustry Placement Capacity and Delivery Fund (CDF) 2019 to 2020\nThe unprecedented impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) has meant that it is\ncurrently extremely difficult for providers to continue to organise and\ndeliver industry placements through the Capacity and Delivery Fund (CDF).\nGiven these exceptional and unprecedented circumstances, providers will not be\npenalised for missing specific CDF industry placement targets this academic\nyear. Funding will not be clawed back if providers can demonstrate how the\nfunding has and will continue to support your work on industry placement\ndelivery. We want to make sure that providers are able to maximise the\nactivity that they are able to carry out during this period to continue to\nsupport the delivery of placements, and to prepare to deliver placements in\n2020 to 2021. Activities we would expect to continue to go ahead:\n\ncontinuing to build relationships with employers and developing engagement strategies for different industries\npreparing students for placements (such as through virtual training for work programmes)\nensuring alignment between curriculum planning and industry placement provision\ndeveloping matching processes for when students can go on placements again\n\nWe will ask for evidence of this through the usual autumn CDF monitoring\nprocess in order to minimise reporting burdens, and we will still look to claw\nback funding under the usual arrangements should providers fail to demonstrate\nthey have continued to support the delivery of industry placements. Providers\nmust avoid the risk of double funding. We will seek to claw back funding\nshould providers furlough staff involved in these activities.\nFree meals in further education\nWe expect further education institutions to continue to support students who\nare eligible for, and usually receive, free meals in further education, or are\nnewly eligible, whether they are continuing to attend the provider or are\nstudying remotely due to coronavirus (COVID-19) related issues.

                        "section_content_html": "<p>We currently use the profile of recruitment throughout the year to determine\nthe lagged student numbers used in 16 to 19 allocations. For providers who\nrecruit learners later in the year rather than purely at the beginning of the\nacademic year, and whose enrolment of new learners in the summer term will\nhave ceased, we will determine a way to ensure this does not have an unfairly\ndetrimental impact on future allocations. For example, we could still apply\nthe current approach of identifying what proportion of student numbers were\nrecruited after we take the initial data return in the autumn but use full\nyear data from 2018/19.</p>\n<h4>Student prior attainment in English and/or maths GCSEs</h4>\n<p>Three elements within the 16 to 19 funding formula use students\u2019 prior\nattainment in English and/or maths, namely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the condition of funding</li>\n<li>disadvantage funding - block 2</li>\n<li>level 3 programme maths and English payment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We anticipate that these will continue to be calculated as now following the\nalternative plans that have now been published to award grades to students in\nthe absence of GCSE exams this summer, and so providers will still be\nallocated additional funding for young people with low prior attainment in\nGCSE English or maths. As further details are published for how the\nreplacement for exams will work, we will consider these elements in more\ndetail.</p>\n<h4>Funding to prepare for and deliver T levels</h4>\n<p>Allocations have been made to providers who will be delivering the first wave\nof T levels in 2020 to 2021 based on planned T level student numbers. We have\nalready published the approach for applying a tolerance where enrolment of T\nlevel students is below the planned number.</p>\n<p>Due to the lagged student number approach, where the level of T level students\nrecruited means the tolerance would be implemented, only the numbers above the\ntolerance would be converted to a full-time band 5 student. Read more about\nthe tolerance in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-t-levels-will-be-funded-in-academic-\nyear-2020-to-2021\">How T levels will be funded in 2020 to\n2021</a> guidance.</p>\n<p>We will monitor the suitability of this approach over the coming months as we\nget nearer to the introduction of T levels.</p>\n<h4>Industry Placement Capacity and Delivery Fund (CDF) 2019 to 2020</h4>\n<p>The unprecedented impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) has meant that it is\ncurrently extremely difficult for providers to continue to organise and\ndeliver industry placements through the Capacity and Delivery Fund (CDF).</p>\n<p>Given these exceptional and unprecedented circumstances, providers will not be\npenalised for missing specific CDF industry placement targets this academic\nyear. Funding will not be clawed back if providers can demonstrate how the\nfunding has and will continue to support your work on industry placement\ndelivery. We want to make sure that providers are able to maximise the\nactivity that they are able to carry out during this period to continue to\nsupport the delivery of placements, and to prepare to deliver placements in\n2020 to 2021. Activities we would expect to continue to go ahead:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>continuing to build relationships with employers and developing engagement strategies for different industries</li>\n<li>preparing students for placements (such as through virtual training for work programmes)</li>\n<li>ensuring alignment between curriculum planning and industry placement provision</li>\n<li>developing matching processes for when students can go on placements again</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will ask for evidence of this through the usual autumn CDF monitoring\nprocess in order to minimise reporting burdens, and we will still look to claw\nback funding under the usual arrangements should providers fail to demonstrate\nthey have continued to support the delivery of industry placements. Providers\nmust avoid the risk of double funding. We will seek to claw back funding\nshould providers furlough staff involved in these activities.</p>\n<h4>Free meals in further education</h4>\n<p>We expect further education institutions to continue to support students who\nare eligible for, and usually receive, free meals in further education, or are\nnewly eligible, whether they are continuing to attend the provider or are\nstudying remotely due to coronavirus (COVID-19) related issues.

This is to avoid duplication of funding, such as providing both supplier relief under PPN 02/20 and payment of related workers that have been furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS)\nstage 2: Assessment of whether they are a critical supplier to your organisation: The main consideration here is whether you feel the supplier provides services, goods or works that are critical in the medium and long term, and are important to business continuity to provide relief against the contract\nstage 3: Assessment of whether the supplier is financially \u2018at risk\u2019 as a result of COVID-19: In principle, a supplier is deemed at risk where they are unable to fulfil the contractual obligations of a contract due to COVID-19 and are experiencing financial difficulties as a result\nstage 4: Commercial interventions to manage supplier: It is important that commercial judgement is used when considering the type of support available pursuant to the PPN, which could include: \npayments for previously anticipated volumes (even if not met), or for the advanced order of materials where appropriate\ncontinuing to pay for services to suppliers who give their best endeavours to continue delivery despite performance being somewhat affected\nconsidering an extension of time for contract performance (for example, revised milestones or delivery dates)\nadjusting agreed lead times which despite best endeavours might not be met by suppliers and ensure their payments are not negatively affected by that\nconsider supplementing service delivery through your own resources, though this is likely to be difficult, but may help alleviate the challenges the supplier is suffering as a result of COVID-19\n\n\nstage 5: Financial interventions: As with the commercial interventions, financial judgement should be used when considering any of the suggested options below: \nvariation of payment mechanism - specifically beneficial where contracts are based upon the delivery of outcomes or outputs, you can vary the payment mechanisms to provide greater short term cash flow to the supplier, for example, moving from payments on delivery of services, works or goods to aligning payments to the costs being incurred by the supplier, or breaking down milestone payments into multiple smaller payments\nincreasing speed of payment - this PPN seeks to expedite this process and adjust normal financial controls, such as paying reconciled invoices before their due date\nprepayment of up to 25% of contract value - this specifically targets immediate cash flow issues, but potentially creates a cash flow issue at a later date in the contract, so should be considered accordingly. For example, releasing a proportion of retained funds on capital projects, ahead of actual defects being identified and remedied\n\n\n\nIt is important that any commercial or financial changes or variations to\ncontracts should be agreed in accordance with the change control clauses\ncontained in the contracts, and documented, even if this takes place\nretrospectively.

No one is obliged to work in an unsafe work environment.   </li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this assessment you should have particular regard to whether the people\ndoing the work are especially vulnerable to COVID-19.</p>\n<p>The recommendations in the rest of this document are ones you should consider\nas you go through this process. You could also consider any advice that has\nbeen produced specifically for your sector, for example by trade associations\nor trades unions.</p>\n<p>If you have not already done so, you should carry out an assessment of the\nrisks posed by COVID-19 in your workplace as soon as possible. If you are\ncurrently operating, you are likely to have gone through a lot of this\nthinking already.
