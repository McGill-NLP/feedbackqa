Employers must work with\nany other employers or contractors sharing the workplace so that everybody’s\nhealth and safety is protected. In the context of COVID-19 this means working\nthrough these steps in order:\n\n\nIn every workplace, increasing the frequency of handwashing and surface cleaning.\n\n\nBusinesses and workplaces should make every reasonable effort to enable working from home as a first option. Where working from home is not possible, workplaces should make every reasonable effort to comply with the social distancing guidelines set out by the government (keeping people 2m apart wherever possible).\n\n\nWhere the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full, in relation to a particular activity, businesses should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business to operate, and if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between their staff.   \n\n\nFurther mitigating actions include:  \n– increasing the frequency of handwashing and surface cleaning  \n– keeping the activity time involved as short as possible\n– using screens or barriers to separate people from each other\n– using back-to-back or side-to-side working (rather than face-to-face)\nwhenever possible\n– reducing the number of people each person has contact with by using ‘fixed\nteams or partnering’ (so each person works with only a few others)\n\nFinally, if people must work face-to-face for a sustained period with more than a small group of fixed partners, then you will need to assess whether the activity can safely go ahead. No one is obliged to work in an unsafe work environment.   \n\nIn this assessment you should have particular regard to whether the people\ndoing the work are especially vulnerable to COVID-19.\nThe recommendations in the rest of this document are ones you should consider\nas you go through this process. You could also consider any advice that has\nbeen produced specifically for your sector, for example by trade associations\nor trades unions.\nIf you have not already done so, you should carry out an assessment of the\nrisks posed by COVID-19 in your workplace as soon as possible. If you are\ncurrently operating, you are likely to have gone through a lot of this\nthinking already.

In the context of COVID-19 this means working\nthrough these steps in order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>In every workplace, increasing the frequency of handwashing and surface cleaning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Businesses and workplaces should make every reasonable effort to enable working from home as a first option.

It can include\nitems such as safety helmets, gloves, eye protection, high-visibility\nclothing, safety footwear and safety harnesses. It also includes respiratory\nprotective equipment, such as face masks.\nWhere you are already using PPE in your work activity to protect against non-\nCOVID-19 risks, you should continue to do so.\nAt the start of this document we described the steps you need to take to\nmanage COVID-19 risk in the workplace. This includes working from home and\nstaying 2m away from each other in the workplace if at all possible. When\nmanaging the risk of COVID-19, additional PPE beyond what you usually wear is\nnot beneficial. This is because COVID-19 is a different type of risk to the\nrisks you normally face in a workplace, and needs to be managed through social\ndistancing, hygiene and fixed teams or partnering, not through the use of PPE.\nThe exception is clinical settings, like a hospital, or a small handful of\nother roles for which Public Health England advises use of PPE. For example,\nfirst responders and immigration enforcement officers. If you are in one of\nthese groups you should refer to the advice at:\n\nCOVID-19: personal protective equipment (PPE) plan\nCOVID-19: cleaning in non-healthcare settings\n\nWorkplaces should not encourage the precautionary use of extra PPE to protect\nagainst COVID-19 outside clinical settings or when responding to a suspected\nor confirmed case of COVID-19.\nUnless you are in a situation where the risk of COVID-19 transmission is very\nhigh, your risk assessment should reflect the fact that the role of PPE in\nproviding additional protection is extremely limited. However, if your risk\nassessment does show that PPE is required, then you must provide this PPE free\nof charge to workers who need it.

It can include\nitems such as safety helmets, gloves, eye protection, high-visibility\nclothing, safety footwear and safety harnesses. It also includes respiratory\nprotective equipment, such as face masks.</p>\n<p>Where you are already using PPE in your work activity to protect against non-\nCOVID-19 risks, you should continue to do so.</p>\n<p>At the start of this document we described the steps you need to take to\nmanage COVID-19 risk in the workplace. This includes working from home and\nstaying 2m away from each other in the workplace if at all possible. When\nmanaging the risk of COVID-19, additional PPE beyond what you usually wear is\nnot beneficial. This is because COVID-19 is a different type of risk to the\nrisks you normally face in a workplace, and needs to be managed through social\ndistancing, hygiene and fixed teams or partnering, not through the use of PPE.</p>\n<p>The exception is clinical settings, like a hospital, or a small handful of\nother roles for which Public Health England advises use of PPE. For example,\nfirst responders and immigration enforcement officers. If you are in one of\nthese groups you should refer to the advice at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe-plan/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe-plan\">COVID-19: personal protective equipment (PPE) plan</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings\">COVID-19: cleaning in non-healthcare settings</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Workplaces should not encourage the precautionary use of extra PPE to protect\nagainst COVID-19 outside clinical settings or when responding to a suspected\nor confirmed case of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Unless you are in a situation where the risk of COVID-19 transmission is very\nhigh, your risk assessment should reflect the fact that the role of PPE in\nproviding additional protection is extremely limited. However, if your risk\nassessment does show that PPE is required, then you must provide this PPE free\nof charge to workers who need it. Any PPE provided must fit properly.</p>\n<p><em>[PPE]: Personal protective equipment\n  </em>[COVID-19]: coronavirus</p>"

This means you need to think about the risks they\nface and do everything reasonably practicable to minimise them, recognising\nyou cannot completely eliminate the risk of COVID-19.\nYou must make sure that the risk assessment for your business addresses the\nrisks of COVID-19, using this guidance to inform your decisions and control\nmeasures. A risk assessment is not about creating huge amounts of paperwork,\nbut rather about identifying sensible measures to control the risks in your\nworkplace. If you have fewer than 5 workers, or are self-employed, you don’t\nhave to write anything down as part of your risk assessment. Your risk\nassessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to.\nThe Health and Safety Executive has guidance for business on how to manage\nrisk and risk assessment at work along with specific advice to help control the risk of\ncoronavirus in workplaces.\nEmployers have a duty to consult their people on health and safety. You can do\nthis by listening and talking to them about the work and how you will manage\nrisks from COVID-19. The people who do the work are often the best people to\nunderstand the risks in the workplace and will have a view on how to work\nsafely. Involving them in making decisions shows that you take their health\nand safety seriously. You must consult with the health and safety\nrepresentative selected by a recognised trade union or, if there isn’t one, a\nrepresentative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the\nrepresentative will be.\nAt its most effective, full involvement of your workers creates a culture\nwhere relationships between employers and workers are based on collaboration,\ntrust and joint problem solving.

Under such circumstances, provided the landlord can demonstrate they have taken reasonable steps to comply, they would not be in breach. See further Health and Safety Executive guidance on how to deal with specific circumstances. Letting agents may also want to consider obtaining landlord and tenant consent for inventory clerk appointments to also occur before a tenant moves in or after a tenant moves out during vacant periods if possible.\nLetting agents and landlords should take steps to ensure any properties are prepared ready for new tenants, this may include cleaning to minimise any potential spread of the virus in line with government advice.\nLetting agents and landlords should consider how best to conduct tenancy check-ins for new tenancies agreed while broader measures remain in place, taking care to follow government advice on social distancing to minimise possible spread of coronavirus.\nLetting agents and landlords are reminded of the temporary COVID-19 measures that adjust right to rent checks, temporarily allowing these checks to be conducted remotely.

                        "section_content": "Consider how to connect with others: Maintaining relationships with people\nyou trust is important for your mental wellbeing. Think about how you can stay\nin touch with friends and family via telephone, video calls or social media\ninstead of meeting in person – whether it’s people you normally see often or\nconnecting with old friends.\nHelp and support others: Think about how you could help those around you –\nit could make a big difference to them and can make you feel better too. Could\nyou message a friend or family member nearby? Are there community groups that\nyou could join to support others locally? Remember it’s important to do this\nin line with guidance on coronavirus (COVID-19) to keep yourself and everyone\nsafe. And try to be accepting of other people’s concerns, worries or\nbehaviours.\nTalk about your worries: It is quite common to feel worried, scared or\nhelpless about the current situation. Remember that this is a difficult time\nfor everyone and sharing how you are feeling and the things you are doing to\ncope with family and friends can help them too. If you don’t feel able to do\nthat, there are people you can speak to via NHS recommended\nhelplines or you could find support groups online to connect with.\nLook after your physical wellbeing: Your physical health has a big impact\non how you are feeling emotionally and mentally. At times like these, it can\nbe easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour which in turn can make\nyou feel worse. Try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals, drink enough water,\nexercise inside where possible and outside once a day, and try to avoid\nsmoking, alcohol and drugs.\nIf you are able to go outside, consider walking or gardening (keeping the\nrecommended 2 metres from others as outlined in the social distancing\nguidance). If you are staying at home, you can\nfind free easy 10 minute work outs from Public Health England or other\nexercise videos to try at home on the NHS Fitness\nStudio. Sport England also\nhas good tips for keeping active at home.\nLook after your sleep: Feeling anxious or worried can make it harder to\nget a good night’s sleep. Good-quality sleep makes a big difference to how you\nfeel mentally and physically, so it’s important to get enough.\nTry to maintain regular sleeping patterns and keep good sleep hygiene\npractices – like avoiding screens before bed, cutting back on caffeine and\ncreating a restful environment. The Every Mind Matters sleep\npage provides practical\nadvice on how to improve your sleep.\nTry to manage difficult feelings: Many people find the news about\ncoronavirus (COVID-19) concerning. However, some people may experience such\nintense anxiety that it becomes a problem. Try to focus on the things you can\ncontrol, including where you get information from and actions to make yourself\nfeel better prepared.\nIt is okay to acknowledge some things that are outside of your control right\nnow but constant repetitive thoughts about the situation which lead you to\nfeel anxious or overwhelmed are not helpful. The Every Mind Matters page on\nanxiety and NHS\nmental wellbeing audio guides provide further\ninformation on how to manage anxiety.\nManage your media and information intake: 24-hour news and constant social\nmedia updates can make you more worried. If it is affecting you, try to limit\nthe time you spend watching, reading, or listening to media coverage of the\noutbreak. It may help to only check the news at set times or limiting to a\ncouple of checks a day.\nGet the facts: Gather high-quality information that will help you to\naccurately determine your own or other people’s risk of contracting\ncoronavirus (COVID-19) so that you can take reasonable precautions. Find a\ncredible source you can trust such as\nGOV.UK, or the NHS\nwebsite, and fact check\ninformation that you get from newsfeeds, social media or from other people.\nThink about how possibly inaccurate information could affect others too. Try\nnot to share information without fact-checking against credible sources.\nThink about your new daily routine: Life is changing for us all for a\nwhile. Whether you are staying at home or social distancing, you are likely to\nsee some disruption to your normal routine.\nThink about how you can adapt and create positive new routines – try to engage\nin useful activities (such as cleaning, cooking or exercise) or meaningful\nactivities (such as reading or calling a friend). You might find it helpful to\nwrite a plan for your day or your week.\nDo things you enjoy: When you are anxious, lonely or low you may do things\nthat you usually enjoy less often, or not at all. Focussing on your favourite\nhobby, learning something new or simply taking time to relax indoors should\ngive you some relief from anxious thoughts and feelings and can boost your\nmood.\nIf you can’t do the things you normally enjoy because you are staying at home,\ntry to think about how you could adapt them, or try something new. There are\nlots of free tutorials and courses online and people are coming up with\ninnovative online solutions like online pub quizzes and streamed live music\nconcerts.\nSet goals: Setting goals and achieving them gives a sense of control and\npurpose – think about things you want or need to do that you can still do at\nhome. It could be watching a film, reading a book or learning something\nonline.\nKeep your mind active: Read, write, play games, do crossword puzzles,\nsudokus, jigsaws or drawing and painting. Find something that works for you.\nTake time to relax and focus on the present: This can help with difficult\nemotions, worries about the future, and can improve wellbeing. Relaxation\ntechniques can also help some people to deal with feelings of anxiety. For\nuseful resources see Every Mind Matters and NHS’ mindfulness\npage.\nIf you can, once a day get outside, or bring nature in: Spending time in\ngreen spaces can benefit both your mental and physical wellbeing.

Over time, as restrictions are\nlifted, providers will begin to re-introduce classroom and workshop-based\nlearning. For many learners, this will mean a transition from remote learning\nto blended learning (e.g. a combination of remote and traditional classroom,\nworkshop or workplace learning).\nGiven resources are finite - estate, equipment and staff - the varied needs of\ndifferent learner groups and courses will need to be balanced, providers will\nneed flexibility in deciding the optimal mix of online and face to face\ncontent across their curriculum to maximise learner engagement, support\nvulnerable learners, and enable the provider as a whole to minimise the\ntransmission risk. Providers will also need to take account of learners who\nmay have family members who are shielding and therefore do not wish to\nphysically attend.\nTwo DfE grant funded organisations - Jisc and The Education and Training\nFoundation (ETF) – are well-placed to advise and support colleges and staff\nregarding remote teaching and learning.\nSupport available includes free content, blogs, and community support. The\nETF’s Enhance Digital Learning Platform offers free training to teachers in\nhow to use technology to support the continuity of teaching and learning. ETF\nis also running webinars for FE providers\non how to make the most of online learning.\nProviders’ strategies for ongoing learning should be informed by the needs of\nteachers and students, and their respective home teaching and learning\nenvironments. Where possible, colleges and other providers should:\n\n\nPrepare staff on remote learning practice through bitesize/refresher training sessions focused on how to use college virtual learning environments (VLEs), communication tools and digital and non-digital resources.\n\n\nUse tools already available at your college including physical and digital resources, and how to make use of cloud storage systems (for example, Office 365 or Google G Suite). Ensure staff and students have log-in details and know how to access online content.\n\n\nProvide students with accessible guides on remote learning, focusing on where, when and how they are expected to engage and demonstrate their learning and how assessment and feedback will be delivered.

We will be consulting with\nsector representatives in order to develop some ‘models’ of how this could\noperate, and this will be published along with further guidance for secondary\nschools and colleges and other providers in the week commencing 18 May.</p>\n<p>The Department’s guidance on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-\ncovid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings\">implementing protective measures in education\nand childcare\nsettings</a>\ncontains detailed advice on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cleaning, including supplies of cleaning and handwashing products</li>\n<li>testing and tracing</li>\n<li>PPE</li>\n<li>what settings should do in response to a case of coronavirus being confirmed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We recognise that for some programmes, online learning will be working\neffectively with a high degree of learner engagement (while some families may,\nfor example, include family members who are shielding and therefore learners\nare not able to physically attend). Colleges and other providers will have\nflexibility to decide the appropriate mix of online and face to face content\nfor each programme, reflecting what will maximise learner engagement as well\nas supporting more vulnerable learners, and enabling the provider as a whole\nto minimise transmission risk.</p>\n<p>For 16 to 19-year-old learners eligible to return, in balancing on-site and\nonline delivery, colleges may consider the following issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which learners are most at risk of disengagement through online learning (typically at lower academic levels).</li>\n<li>Learners that require on-site provision in order to undertake technical instruction which requires the use of equipment.</li>\n<li>The impact on the risk of transmission (for example it may be easier to undertake instruction in outside settings or larger spaces). Some types of vocational instruction may be more challenging where they by their nature involve personal contact.</li>\n<li>Where online learning is working well with high engagement, colleges may wish to maintain a larger element of online delivery.</li>\n<li>It may be advantageous to offer all learners some face to face contact, even if to varying degrees.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>[FE]: further education\n  </em>[PPE]: personal protective equipment</p>"

This might include children on the edge of receiving support from children’s social care services, adopted children, those at risk of becoming NEET (‘not in employment, education or training’), those living in temporary accommodation, those who are young carers and others at the provider and local authority’s discretion.\n\nMore information, including the expectations around attendance and encouraging\nattendance for different groups of vulnerable young people, can be found in\nSupporting vulnerable children and young people during the coronavirus\n(COVID-19) outbreak.\nFrom the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, we will be asking colleges\nand other providers to invite increasing numbers of young people to return to\non-site provision, alongside priority groups (vulnerable young people and\nchildren of critical workers). Special post-16 institutions will work towards\na phased return of more young people without a focus on specific year groups.\nThe government has set out guidance on staying alert and safe (social\ndistancing) to help educational settings support safe provision\nfor everyone who attends.\nMany colleges and other providers have already taken steps to support\nvulnerable young people, and the children of critical workers who cannot be\nsupported elsewhere, and we are grateful to providers for the vital role they\nare playing in supporting the national response to coronavirus.\nSpecifically, we are asking that colleges and other providers:\n\n\ncontinue to provide a safe space and encourage attendance: Being in an educational setting can be an important lifeline for many vulnerable young people, particularly where their needs cannot be met safely at home or where they may be at risk of harm.\n\n\nThere is a continuing expectation now and throughout the period from the week commencing 1 June at the earliest that vulnerable young people – regardless of year group – will attend educational provision, where it is safe and appropriate for them do so.\n\n\nFrom the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, young people in returning year groups – including vulnerable young people - are strongly encouraged to attend their educational setting where possible, unless they are ill, or guidance says they should not attend.\n\n\nProviders are expected to follow the process set out on encouraging, enabling and monitoring attendance and following up on non-attendance, see Supporting vulnerable children and young people during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.\n\n\nWe appreciate that decisions on attendance will likely be based on finely balanced discussions between the education provider, the parent/carer and others, including social workers, local authorities and other relevant professionals where applicable. The decision might be taken that the learner should attend the educational setting on a full-time or part-time basis, depending on the needs of the individual. We also appreciate that circumstances do change and therefore attendance decisions should be kept under review. For young people with an education, health and care (EHC) plan, colleges and other providers should ensure that existing risk assessments are up to date. \n\nWhere vulnerable young people are already attending educational settings, they should continue to do so. Where young people are currently not attending but attendance is appropriate, we expect providers and local authorities to consider how to encourage their attendance.\nIf it is not possible for a vulnerable young person to attend a provider due to public transport routes being closed, then providers should speak to the local authority to consider what alternative transport arrangements could be put in place.\n\n\nMake alternative arrangements: We are asking colleges and other providers that have been closed to work towards wider opening from the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, so we expect the number of colleges and other providers that are closed to decline. However, in the meantime if a college or another provider is closed, the provider should notify the local authority/social worker. Providers should work with the local authority to ensure that the vulnerable young people who normally attend can be found a place in another educational setting. Providers can also contact their local ESFA team to discuss wider opening and which other local providers it may be possible for them to work with.\nKeep in contact with all vulnerable learners: As per the existing guidance on vulnerable children and young people, all vulnerable young people continue to be expected and encouraged to attend educational provision where it is appropriate for them to do so. Colleges and other providers which are currently closed are being asked to work towards wider opening from the week commencing 1 June at the earliest.\nHowever, where it is not safe for vulnerable learners to attend, or vulnerable learners cannot be persuaded to attend education settings, colleges and other providers should maintain regular communication with social workers, vulnerable leaners and their families to ensure they know where their vulnerable learners are and that they are safe. Colleges and other providers should continue to encourage attendance where appropriate. The frequency of contact required will depend on the individual’s circumstances and needs and will be based on the assessment of risk. Social workers will remain in contact with vulnerable learners and their families, including remotely if needed.\n\nSection 15 below is a collection of examples from providers who are\nsuccessfully engaging vulnerable young people.

A\ntailored approach, within these guiding principles, will be required to ensure\nan approach that is practicable, safe and which meets, as far as is possible,\nthe needs of the learners, staff and wider community. This guidance will not\nbe exhaustive and there may be particular circumstances which necessitate the\nconsideration of factors not covered here.</p>\n<p>It is recognised that many college leaders and boards have already been\nscenario planning for this eventuality, taking measures to risk assess and\nprepare in general terms, whilst awaiting further detail of proposals. This\nguidance aims to further assist preparations.</p>\n<p>Guidance documents that this should be read in conjunction with this are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care\">Safe working in education, childcare and children’s social care</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-vulnerable-children-and-young-people\">Supporting vulnerable children and young people during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-safeguarding-in-schools-colleges-and-other-providers\">Coronavirus (COVID-19): safeguarding in schools, colleges and other providers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2\">Keeping Children Safe in Education 2019</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2\">Working Together to Safeguard Children</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition the following documents published on 11 May provide updated\ninformation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/details-on-phased-wider-opening-of-schools-colleges-and-nurseries\">Press notice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-educational-and-childcare-settings-to-prepare-for-wider-opening-from-1-june-2020\">Actions for educational and childcare settings</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings\">Implementing protective measures in education childcare settings</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers\">Information for parents and carers</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Further guidance will be published as appropriate.</p>\n<p>Colleges should also be aware of support and advice that may be available from\ntrade associations, and the Health &amp; Safety Executive.</p>\n<h4>Checklist theme</h4>\n<p>1.0 Governance and leadership</p>\n<h4>Key consideration</h4>\n<p>Ensure that there is a comprehensive plan for increased numbers of learners\nattending and associated risk plan in place.

This approach, which reflects the\ncomplexity and scale of the DfE’s commercial arrangements, is intended to\nprovide you with some overarching guidance and principles as to how you could\nchoose to implement the PPN.\n\nstage 1: Assessment of whether the supplier has considered other measures announced by the government: This involves asking if they have explored and applied for, as applicable, all other forms of support available to them, including the wider government business support schemes. This is to avoid duplication of funding, such as providing both supplier relief under PPN 02/20 and payment of related workers that have been furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS)\nstage 2: Assessment of whether they are a critical supplier to your organisation: The main consideration here is whether you feel the supplier provides services, goods or works that are critical in the medium and long term, and are important to business continuity to provide relief against the contract\nstage 3: Assessment of whether the supplier is financially ‘at risk’ as a result of COVID-19: In principle, a supplier is deemed at risk where they are unable to fulfil the contractual obligations of a contract due to COVID-19 and are experiencing financial difficulties as a result\nstage 4: Commercial interventions to manage supplier: It is important that commercial judgement is used when considering the type of support available pursuant to the PPN, which could include: \npayments for previously anticipated volumes (even if not met), or for the advanced order of materials where appropriate\ncontinuing to pay for services to suppliers who give their best endeavours to continue delivery despite performance being somewhat affected\nconsidering an extension of time for contract performance (for example, revised milestones or delivery dates)\nadjusting agreed lead times which despite best endeavours might not be met by suppliers and ensure their payments are not negatively affected by that\nconsider supplementing service delivery through your own resources, though this is likely to be difficult, but may help alleviate the challenges the supplier is suffering as a result of COVID-19\n\n\nstage 5: Financial interventions: As with the commercial interventions, financial judgement should be used when considering any of the suggested options below: \nvariation of payment mechanism - specifically beneficial where contracts are based upon the delivery of outcomes or outputs, you can vary the payment mechanisms to provide greater short term cash flow to the supplier, for example, moving from payments on delivery of services, works or goods to aligning payments to the costs being incurred by the supplier, or breaking down milestone payments into multiple smaller payments\nincreasing speed of payment - this PPN seeks to expedite this process and adjust normal financial controls, such as paying reconciled invoices before their due date\nprepayment of up to 25% of contract value - this specifically targets immediate cash flow issues, but potentially creates a cash flow issue at a later date in the contract, so should be considered accordingly. For example, releasing a proportion of retained funds on capital projects, ahead of actual defects being identified and remedied\n\n\n\nIt is important that any commercial or financial changes or variations to\ncontracts should be agreed in accordance with the change control clauses\ncontained in the contracts, and documented, even if this takes place\nretrospectively. The Cabinet Office has developed a series of model clauses\npertaining to\nCOVID-19.\nThere are a number of other important points to note when considering how best\nto implement PPN 02/20 for your organisation:\n\nwhatever approach you decide best meets your needs, you need to ensure you apply the necessary financial and governance controls applicable to your organisation\nthe PPN is very clear about the importance of transparency, and suppliers agreeing to act on an open book basis and make cost data available to you during this period, so please ensure they do so where relevant\nkeeping a record of your agreed approach and supporting rationale, along with details of any payments made, assessment of risks or contractual changes, is important to show that you have an audit trail.

Employers must work with\nany other employers or contractors sharing the workplace so that everybody’s\nhealth and safety is protected. In the context of COVID-19 this means working\nthrough these steps in order:\n\n\nIn every workplace, increasing the frequency of handwashing and surface cleaning.\n\n\nBusinesses and workplaces should make every reasonable effort to enable working from home as a first option. Where working from home is not possible, workplaces should make every reasonable effort to comply with the social distancing guidelines set out by the government (keeping people 2m apart wherever possible).\n\n\nWhere the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full, in relation to a particular activity, businesses should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business to operate, and, if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between their staff.   \n\n\nFurther mitigating actions include:  \n– increasing the frequency of handwashing and surface cleaning\n– keeping the activity time involved as short as possible\n– using screens or barriers to separate people from each other\n– using back-to-back or side-to-side working (rather than face-to-face)\nwhenever possible\n– reducing the number of people each person has contact with by using ‘fixed\nteams or partnering’ (so each person works with only a few others)\n\nFinally, if people must work face-to-face for a sustained period with more than a small group of fixed partners, then you will need to assess whether the activity can safely go ahead. No one is obliged to work in an unsafe work environment.   \n\nIn your assessment you should have particular regard to whether the people\ndoing the work are especially vulnerable to COVID-19.\nThe recommendations in the rest of this document are ones you should consider\nas you go through this process.

Employers must work with\nany other employers or contractors sharing the workplace so that everybody’s\nhealth and safety is protected. In the context of COVID-19 this means working\nthrough these steps in order:\n\n\nIn every workplace, increasing the frequency of handwashing and surface cleaning.\n\n\nBusinesses and workplaces should make every reasonable effort to enable working from home as a first option. Where working from home is not possible, workplaces should make every reasonable effort to comply with the social distancing guidelines set out by the government (keeping people 2m apart wherever possible).\n\n\nWhere the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full, in relation to a particular activity, businesses should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business to operate, and, if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between their staff.\n\n\nFurther mitigating actions include:   \n\n\n– increasing the frequency of hand washing and surface cleaning\n– keeping the activity time involved as short as possible\n– using screens or barriers to separate people from each other\n– using back-to-back or side-to-side working (rather than face-to-face)\nwhenever possible\n– reducing the number of people each person has contact with by using ‘fixed\nteams or partnering’ (so each person works with only a few others)\n\n\nFinally, if people must work face-to-face for a sustained period with more than a small group of fixed partners, then you will need to assess whether the activity can safely go ahead. No one is obliged to work in an unsafe work environment.\n\n\nIn your assessment you should have particular regard to whether the people doing the work are especially vulnerable to COVID-19.\n\n\nThe recommendations in the rest of this document are ones you should consider\nas you go through this process.

This means you need to think about the risks they\nface and do everything reasonably practicable to minimise them, recognising\nyou cannot completely eliminate the risk of COVID-19.\nYou must make sure that the risk assessment for your business addresses the\nrisks of COVID-19, using this guidance to inform your decisions and control\nmeasures. A risk assessment is not about creating huge amounts of paperwork,\nbut rather about identifying sensible measures to control the risks in your\nworkplace. If you have fewer than 5 workers, or are self-employed, you don’t\nhave to write anything down as part of your risk assessment. Your risk\nassessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to.\nThe Health and Safety Executive has guidance for business on how to manage\nrisk and risk assessment at work along with specific advice to help control the risk of\ncoronavirus in workplaces.\nEmployers have a duty to consult their people on health and safety. You can do\nthis by listening and talking to them about the work and how you will manage\nrisks from COVID-19. The people who do the work are often the best people to\nunderstand the risks in the workplace and will have a view on how to work\nsafely. Involving them in making decisions shows that you take their health\nand safety seriously. You must consult with the health and safety\nrepresentative selected by a recognised trade union or, if there isn’t one, a\nrepresentative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the\nrepresentative will be.\nAt its most effective, full involvement of your workers creates a culture\nwhere relationships between employers and workers are based on collaboration,\ntrust and joint problem solving. As is normal practice, workers should be\ninvolved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of\nworkplace health and safety policies in partnership with the employer.\nEmployers and workers should always come together to resolve issues.

In our previous version of the guidance it\nwas suggested that the use of Entonox (gas and air) may increase\naerosolisation and spread of the virus, but a review of the evidence suggests\nthere is no evidence that Entonox is an aerosol-prone procedure, so there is\nno reason you cannot use this in labour.</p>"

It is unclear\nwhether coronavirus caused these premature births, or whether it was\nrecommended that their babies were born early for the benefit of the women’s\nhealth and to enable them to recover.\nIn the recent UK study of 427 pregnant women with\ncoronavirus published on 11 May, the data reported outcomes for babies who\nwere born to women with coronavirus severe enough that the woman required\nhospital admission. Although almost one in five were born prematurely and were\nadmitted to a neonatal unit, fewer than 20 babies were born very prematurely\n(when the women were less than 32 weeks’ pregnant). One in 20 babies born (12\nbabies in total) had a positive test for coronavirus, but only half of these\nbabies – 6 babies - had a positive test immediately after birth, suggesting\nthat transmission of the coronavirus infection from a woman to her baby is\nlow. The number of babies born at term (37 weeks or later) to women who had\ntested positive for coronavirus that required neonatal care was similar to the\nnumber of babies born to women without the virus – about 1 in 10.",

The number of babies born at term (37 weeks or later) to women who had\ntested positive for coronavirus that required neonatal care was similar to the\nnumber of babies born to women without the virus – about 1 in 10.</p>"

Instead, we\nhave created an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-educational-\nand-childcare-settings-to-prepare-for-wider-opening-from-1-june-2020/opening-\nschools-for-more-children-and-young-people-initial-planning-framework-for-\nschools-in-england\">initial planning\nframework</a> to help school leaders and trusts to start to think\nthrough the steps they might need to take to enable them to open their schools\nfor more pupils. This framework can be seen as a starting point from which\nschools and trusts may choose to develop their own plans, providing\noperational guidance to support school and trust leaders in agreeing the best\napproaches for their circumstances.</p>"
