However, simply touching a contaminated object does not pose any risk if you wash your hands immediately afterwards and before touching your face. The protective measures to be taken vary from one activity to another. It is always recommended that you avoid touching your face and wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Given that it is difficult to avoid touching your face with your hands, especially during sports activities, it is recommended that shared objects or equipment be disinfected before each person uses them. As much as possible, each participant should also use their own equipment (for example, use your own golf balls, have each tennis player use a different ball). The use of sports equipment that is touched by several people without being disinfected in between (e.g. balls, frisbees) is not recommended. The 2-metre physical distancing rule remains in effect. Consequently, the use of balls or frisbees must allow for this distance to be maintained between people who do not live under the same roof. For example, this rule is easy to follow when practising punting a football. However, following physical distancing rules would be difficult when playing an actual game of soccer, ultimate frisbee or football (CDC).",

The protective measures to be taken vary from one activity to another. It is always recommended that you avoid touching your face and wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Given that it is difficult to avoid touching your face with your hands, especially during sports activities, it is recommended that shared objects or equipment be disinfected before each person uses them. It is also recommended that surfaces that are touched with hands or that may come into contact with mucous membranes (mouth, eyes, nose) be disinfected before each person uses them.

Under the order, even workers coming from other regions can be provided accommodations. The goal is to meet the needs of agricultural producers and bio-food processors whose activities include the operation of agricultural businesses, including the construction and renovation of farm buildings, as well as food processing, beverage production, slaughtering, market garden and horticultural production, fishing, and commercial aquaculture. Owners of tourist accommodation establishments are permitted to enter into exclusive agreements with bio-food producers and processors, but are prohibited from providing tourist accommodations (stays of 31 days or less) to any other guests. If the rental is for 31 days or more, the establishment is not considered a tourist accommodation establishment subject to the regulation. Any contract concluded must therefore specify a rental start and end date and indicate that it cannot be renewed under any circumstances. The lease entered into must specify the purpose of the rental (e.g., by an agricultural producer or bio-food processor as temporary accommodations for their seasonal or temporary workers) and the particular context in which it is being entered into, i.e., the health crisis. Both parties must clearly state their intention not to be bound by a residential lease agreement. The contract must also comply with the municipal planning by-laws relating to uses passed under theAct respecting land use planning and development(CQLR, chapter A-19.1) and be sent to the municipality, borough, or regional county municipality for municipal tax purposes. Owners can go back to offering short-term tourist accommodations once the state of emergency is over or the measures restricting the operation of tourist accommodation establishments and travel between regions have been lifted. They will, however, have to ensure that they are adhering to the terms of the contract.

Consequently, the results of these studies are rarely unequivocal. The theory that applies to washing hands with soap may also be appropriate for washing fruits and vegetables (among other things, because of the surface tension effect or wetting power of soap, which dislodges dirt and contaminants) There is a risk of leaving soap or detergent residues on fruits and vegetables especially those with rough or porous surfaces or if the peel is eaten, which is undesirable. Unlike dishes, fruits and vegetables are porous and residues can easily stay on them. Ultimately, if we compare the risks and benefits, it is wiser to only rinse and scrub fruits and vegetables, when possible, whereas washing hands with soap is advisable.",

In addition, the measures provided for in the declaration of a local state of emergency may not exceed the authority stipulated in section47.Any municipality that has declared a state of emergency under these conditions must send its declaration of a state of emergency to the direction régionale de la sécurité civile et de la sécurité incendie of the ministère de la Sécurité publique, accompanied by proof of authorization from the national public health director.

The World Health Organization (WHO) also maintains that, like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is less resistant in the environment and is likely to become inactive in wastewater. The WHO further maintains that treatments applied upstream of municipal biosolids generation lessens the probability that viruses are present while at the same time reducing viral activity.

It is up to the municipal body to ensure that these witnesses have no connection with the contract in question.Second, in order to ensure that the process is carried out in a transparent manner, the municipal body must post an audiovisual recording of the opening of bids in the form of an addendum in the electronic tendering system(SEAO). The opening in front of witnesses can be filmed by means of a tablet, telephone, or camera. Moreover, the municipal body could, in its tender documents, inform bidders at the outset that the public opening of bids will be accessible, exceptionally, by means of an audiovisual recording filed in the SEAO, in the form of an addendum. In the case of a public call for tenders, this will be transmitted by the SEAO to all purchasers of tender documents. The ministère des Affaires municipals et de l’Habitation recommends that the release of the video be done prior to publishing the conclusion of the contract. Within 30days of its publication by addendum, a citizen will be also able to view the audiovisual recording associated with a call for tenders, provided that he or she has first registered with the SEAO. After this period, the audiovisual recording will no longer be available. In the case of an invited tender, the municipal body must also make its bid opening public through the SEAO. To do so : the municipal body will create a new public tender notice with a notice number that will be sent to suppliers who have been invited to bid, so that they can view the bid opening.after the minimum information in this new public tender notice has been completed, access to an addendum will allow the municipal body to publish its audiovisual recording up to the status \"Pending contract.\" The Ministère recommends that the release of the video be done prior to publishing the conclusion of the contract.in addition to completing the minimum information, in this new public tender notice, the municipal body muststate in the description of the notice that it is not a public tender, but rather the opening results for an invited tender that has not been published on the SEAO.attach at least one Word or PDF document to the notice. To this end, the municipal body must prepare a short document explaining that this notice is used to broadcast the video of the opening results of an invitation to tender that has not been published on the SEAO.select the next day as the deadline for receipt of bids. Once this date is reached, it will be possible to publish the public opening via the Addendum tab.The municipal body will also announce to the public, as soon as it publishes its contract with the SEAO from its list of contracts of $25,000 and over, that the audiovisual recording concerning the opening of bids for this contract is accessible by going to the public tender notice specifically created for this purpose.

                        "section_content": "Please note that this section was substantially modified on May 7, 2020 to take into account order2020-033. No public meetings required by a legislative or regulatory provision applicable to a municipality or metropolitan community may be held. This is the case, in particular, for meetings scheduled for purposes of development and urban planning. In fact, order2020-033 of May7, 2020 provides that any procedure other than a referendum that is part of the decision-making process of a municipal body and that involves the movement or gathering of citizens must be suspended or replaced. Further details on referendum processes and the process of territorial division into electoral districts are provided below. It is the council that determines whether the public meeting is suspended or replaced. Suspension- If its council chooses to suspend the public meeting, the municipality should announce this decision by a public notice of postponement that indicates that a new public notice announcing the meeting will be published once the health emergency is over. In this case, the regulatory adoption process is suspended until further notice. In due course, the ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation will contact municipalities to advise them that normal regulatory adoption processes are being reinstated. Replacement- If a council wishes to continue the process of passing the act that is the subject of the public meeting, it must replace the public meeting normally provided for in the Act with a 15-day written consultation announced in advance by public notice. Contrary to the situation that has prevailed since March 22 as a result of decree 2020-008, it is no longer necessary for the council to designate the priority project by a two-thirds vote of its members. The Ministère recommends that this public notice describe the project that was to be the subject of a meeting but is instead the subject of a call for written comments.specify the web address where a detailed presentation of the project is made available online.indicate that any person may submit written comments, by email or regular mail, during a period of 15 days following publication of the notice. Furthermore, in addition to the written consultation, which is mandatory, a municipality may provide for any other consultation measure that does not involve the movement or gathering of citizens, such as consultation by videoconference. During a health emergency, a project initially suspended by a municipality could be revived at a later date if public notice was given to announce that the public meeting is being replaced by the written consultation described above. A municipality whose administrative capacity is limited by the pandemic could suspend some projects and prioritize others. Optional meetings Besides the usually mandatory consultation meetings, municipalities must not hold optional consultations that involve the movement or gathering of citizens(e.g.,a public hearing by a municipality's demolition committee). The government is asking municipalities to consult with citizens in other ways (e.g., survey or online consultation, videoconferencing, conference calls) or to suspend processes involving optional consultations. Public meeting held following the transmission of notices of objection at the stage of the draft by-law dividing the territory into electoral districts Under the effect of order2020-033 of May 7, 2020, no municipality may suspend its process of division into electoral districts. In the event that the required number of notices of objection is reached at the draft by-law stage (s.18, the Act respecting elections and referendums in municipalities[AERM]), the municipality must replace the meeting provided for in the AERM with a 15-day written consultation, announced in advance by public notice.

                        "section_content": "Under order2020-008 of March22, 2020, any procedure that involved the movement or gathering of citizens that was part of the decision-making process of a municipal body was suspended or replaced. This replacement had to concern projects designated as priorities by a two-thirds vote of council members. In addition, any action taken as a result of such a replacement procedure was not subject to the approval of qualified voters. These provisions of order2020-008 of March 22, 2020 were repealed by order 2020-033 of May7, 2020(see details in the previous question). Thus, any municipal initiative designated as a priority by council under these provisions and for which the written consultation replacing a public meeting ended before May 7, 2020 is not subject to referendum approval. A draft land use planning by-law adopted before May 7, 2020, but for which the 15-day consultation period did not end on May 7, 2020, may therefore be subject to a referendum process if it contains provisions subject to referendum approval. The referendum procedures in effect during a public health emergency are explained below. Furthermore, when the 15-day written consultation concerns a draft land use planning by-law and is underway on May 7, 2020, it does not have to be cancelled. It can be completed and will be valid since the provisions of the new by-law do not modify the rules applicable to the replacement of a public meeting by a written consultation. On the other hand, when the written consultation was meant to replace a referendum procedure (e.g., in the case of a borrowing by-law) and is not completed, it may be cancelled, since it is not provided for in the new procedure (the decision to continue it rests with the municipality). A remote referendum procedure (explained below) must then be held unless council suspends the process. The above applies to a variety of situations. For example, the following draft by-laws are also subject to referendum approval: a draft by-law adopted before March 23, 2020 that has not yet been the subject of a public consultation meeting or written consultation.a draft by-law adopted before March 23, 2020 and for which a consultation meeting has been held according to the ordinary rules of the Act respecting land use planning and development, but for which the second draft by-law has not yet been adopted.a draft by-law that was suspended after March 22, but for which the adoption process has been resumed by council.",

The indications previously provided for public meetings are therefore applicable, unless the municipality is able to guarantee the possibility for citizens to make their voices heard, without any displacement or gathering. Consequently, the municipality has three options: Municipalities may defer the authorization of a minor exemption or conditional use application to a subsequent meeting when the health emergency is lifted. The Act does not prescribe a time limit between the submission of a minor exemption or conditional use application and the adoption by council of the resolution granting the exemption or authorizing the use.They may also replace the possibility of being heard by a written consultation, announced by a 15-day prior public notice. May 7, 2020, it is no longer necessary for council members to determine priority proposals by a two-thirds majority vote.They may also allow their citizens to remotely attend the council meeting where the application will be processed (e.g., by television or webcast) and allow them to be heard. If the municipality is unable to guarantee that all those wishing to participate are able to do so, it should refrain from using this option(e.g., if not all of its territory is connected to high-speed Internet). If the municipality determines that it can hold a remote session without infringing on the right of any citizen to be heard, it should indicate, in the public notice announcing the session, the means for remote participation.provide a range of means for citizens to be heard, including via the Internet(e.g., video conferencing, chat, or pre-scheduled email) and through other means for those without Internet access(e.g., telephone or letter).provide for remote citizen interventions to be heard by the public or read as formulated.",

Pursuant to order2020-008 of March 22, 2020, no referendum poll could be held as of that date. However, order2020-033 of May 7, 2020 amended the applicable rules and it is possible, since that date, for referendum proceedings to be conducted under certain conditions. In particular, during a public health emergency, the process of signing the register is replaced by a remote process, and any referendum must be held by correspondence. Any necessary adaptations must be made to prevent the movement and gathering of citizens. Land use planning and development Any municipal initiative that has been identified as a priority by council under the provisions of order  2020-008 and for which written consultation was completed prior to May 7, 2020 is not subject to referendum approval and may be passed by council. For any other draft by-law, qualified voters may file an application for a referendum and subsequent stages may unfold according to certain specific procedures, explained below. Referendum applications- Council adopts a second draft by-law after the written consultation when the draft by-law contains provisions that are subject to referendum approval. The municipality then publishes a public notice stating that applications may be submitted. Afterwards, qualified voters may file an application for a referendum. The transmission of such applications to the municipality does not require travel or gathering. Various methods allow citizens to prepare applications signed by a number of qualified voters without contact. In this regard, the Ministère des Affaires municipales et de l'Habitation invites municipalities to show flexibility and to receive all applications transmitted, whether individually or by petition, in order to avoid the spread of COVID-19. The number of applications normally required to establish a register, as provided for in the Act respecting land use planning and development, is applicable. Registration procedure- The procedure for registering qualified voters takes 15 days, and the transmission of written applications to the municipality serves as the register. This measure is intended to prevent people from travelling to sign a register. Municipalities should follow these guidelines: Municipalities should accept all applications, whether sent by regular mail or email, in web form or in paper version, as long as they include the documents and information required to establishwhat by-law the application is in respect of.the identity of the person and his or her right to sign the register. Applications should therefore be accompanied by copies of identity documents.The thresholds for holding a referendum are those currently set out in section 553 of the Act respecting elections and referendums in municipalities. The Ministère will soon make available a document in which more precise indications will be given as to how to proceed with this remote registration. Referendum poll- Unless council suspends or withdraws the draft by-law that has been the subject of a sufficient number of applications, the referendum will be held. Pursuant to order2020-033 of May 7, 2020, the vote must be conducted in accordance with the procedures set out in the Regulation respecting voting by mail(chapterE-2.2, r.3), for all qualified voters and without prior formalities. For example, qualified voters residing or not residing on the territory of the municipality shall vote by mail, and it is not necessary for any qualified voter to apply to vote in this manner. In addition, the council does not have to adopt a resolution allowing the exercise of voting by mail. The duration of the postal vote is usually set according to the \"physical\" polling day. However, since the referendum is to be held solely by mail, a polling day is set for the sole purpose of enforcing the deadlines for the conduct of the referendum. In order to allow additional time for the exercise of the right to vote under these special conditions, the period for voting by correspondence is extended to the seventh day following the day fixed for voting. Qualified voters will therefore have up to 18days to transmit their voting envelope. The Ministère will shortly make available a document with more precise indications on how to proceed with this postal vote. Various adaptations will be proposed to ensure that the exercise unfolds as smoothly as possible. Borrowing regulations, credit commitments, and the creation of financial reserves Any municipal initiative that has been designated as a priority by council under the provisions of order2020-008 and for which the written consultation that replaced the referendum process was completed prior to May 7, 2020 does not require referendum approval. For all other projects, the following applies. As is normally the case, qualified voters do not have to submit referendum applications for draft borrowing by-laws, loan commitments, or the creation of financial reserves. For these projects, when the Act provides that they are subject to referendum approval, the municipality will initiate a registration process for qualified voters identical to that described above for draft land use planning and development by-laws. The referendum poll, if applicable, also follows the same steps - it is therefore held by mail-in ballot. The Ministère will soon make available a document providing more specific guidance on how to proceed with these registration and mail-in ballot processes. The Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing must approve all borrowing by-laws, as is customary. Municipal territorial organization The Act respecting municipal territorial organization provides for the possibility of a referendum approval process in certain situations(municipal mergers, change of name, change of status, territorial annexation, attachment to a regional county municipality[RCM], etc.). However, this process shall occur only if the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing so orders, on the date set by the latter. The Minister could choose to wait until the end of the public health emergency to implement such a referendum process. The process would then be suspended until further notice. The Minister could also choose to order the referendum despite the public health emergency, in which case the vote would be conducted by mail-in ballot.",

These decisions must be made by both parents. In case of a disagreement, the issue is decided by the court. Everyday decisionsare made by the parent with whom the child is staying that day. They include things like bedtime hours, food and participation in school activities. Allowing a child to go back to school for the remainder of the year in the context of the pandemic is an important decision that must be made by both parents. It is an important decision given the health risks that can arise from the child continuing to see both parents in two different environments. For instance, fear of contagion can be warranted for a parent who has a pre-existing medical condition. Sending a child to school in this context could prevent a parent with a medical condition from exercising their custody rights. Both parents must therefore agree on whether their child should return to school during the public health emergency.",

Educational childcare services will be free for parents who are essential service workers, which entitles them to emergency daycare services.

At the various checkpoints in the regions concerned, police officers will limit entry and exit and will only authorize travel that is considered to be priority. In order to establish the legitimacy of a person’s journey, police may ask the person to provide supporting documents, such as proof of residence, a driver’s licence or a document provided by an employer. Police officers will be able to use their discretion to make a decision. It is therefore recommended that companies provide their employees who are required to commute, whether to their place of work or as part of their work duties, with a dated letter containing the following elements: the name of the company;a short description of the company's priority activities or services, according to the list of priority services and activities;the name of the employee;the employee's function, with a description providing a link to the company's priority activities or services;the name and telephone number of a contact person in the company to verify, if necessary, the information in the letter;the signature of a director of the company. For more information on travel management and priority services and business activities, see theTravelling from one region to another or from one city to another during the COVID-19 pandemicpage and fullList of essential services and commercial activities.

It can be used for a period of three months as from March 15, 2020 and will be equal to 75% of the wages paid.This wage subsidy is intended to prevent further job losses and also to encourage employers to rehire workers who were laid off as a result of Covid-19. If the business is ineligible for this program, it can apply for theTemporary Wage Subsidy for Employers, which reduces the burden of payroll deductions. As for the Incentive Program to Retain Essential Workers (IPREW), it is offered by the Government of Québec and enhances the Emergency Wage Subsidy. Eligible workers will be able to apply for this assistance online and will receive an additional amount for each recognized week of work. This program provides higher compensation than that offered by the CERB. TheWork-Sharing Programwas also extended to help companies retain employees over a longer period. TheCanada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB)is a combination of the Emergency Care Benefit and the Emergency Support Benefit. Employees, contract workers and self-employed workers who involuntarily lost their jobs are eligible for financial assistance. This benefit cannot be combined with either the Temporary Wage Subsidy or the IPREW. The federal government’sEI benefitsprogram could offer your employees regular or sickness benefits, depending on their eligibility and the terms of their layoff.",

These workers should normally have been identified when disembarking from the plane and be taken into care in a specific isolation unit;Ensure compliance with social distancing measures of 2 metres between people, by reducing the number of workers per bus by at least 50%. If despite this measure, the 2-metre distance is not able to be respected, ensure that physical barriers are set up that do not breach usual safety standards. Otherwise, as a last resort, provide workers with masks during transportation;Make hand washing using hydroalcoholic gel mandatory when both boarding and exiting the bus. Personal food items are not permitted in the bus during transportation to the place of isolation. The employer must provide snacks and water bottles for each person, taking into consideration the duration of the journey.",
