Second, in order to ensure that the process is carried out in a transparent manner, the municipal body must post an audiovisual recording of the opening of bids in the form of an addendum in the electronic tendering system (SEAO).

It is important to remember that collective agreements in the municipal sector remain applicable in the context of a health emergency. The flexibilities required to take the situation into account must therefore be discussed with the associations and unions. Despite the obligation to adopt a balanced budget, a municipality cannot base a decision to lay off employees on the illegality of running a deficit during the year. Indeed, the law expressly provides for mechanisms to enable municipalities to run deficits.

It is the council that determines whether the public meeting is suspended or replaced.Suspension - If its council chooses to suspend the public meeting, the municipality should announce this decision by a public notice of postponement that indicates that a new public notice announcing the meeting will be issued once the health emergency is over.

In due course, the ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation will contact municipalities to advise them that regular regulatory adoption processes are being reinstated.Replacement - If a council wishes to continue the process of passing the act that is the subject of the public meeting, it must designate it as a priority by a two-thirds majority vote. The consultation meeting is then replaced by a written consultation announced 15 days in advance by public notice. This has the effect of cancelling the meeting.   The Ministère recommends that this public notice  describe the project that was to be the subject of a meeting but is instead the subject of a call for written comments.specify the web address where a detailed presentation of the project is made available online.indicate that any person may submit written comments, by email or regular mail, for a period of 15 days following publication of the notice.

Finally, in addition to the usually mandatory consultation meetings, municipalities must not hold optional consultations (e.g., a public hearing by a municipality's demolition committee).

Nevertheless, citizens could submit requests to the municipality to open a register. Here are some additional indications, depending on the situation.Planning and development - For draft by-laws under the Act respecting land use planning and development, the municipality may not proceed with the registration of qualified voters and the referendum process during a health emergency. However, qualified voters may submit applications for referendums. These applications may be forwarded to the municipality individually, rather than by petition, to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The public notice announcing that provisions are subject to referendum approval could invite qualified voters to transmit their requests in this way.  If it receives a sufficient number of requests, the municipality must first determine, by resolution requiring the support of two-thirds of council members, whether the project is a priority.  For projects deemed a priority, the municipality will hold a written consultation identical to the one planned as an alternative to public consultation meetings. This consultation replaces the referendum process and no register is then opened. If it has already held such a written consultation to replace the meeting provided for in the Act, it does not have to repeat it and the regulatory adoption process continues. If such a consultation has not previously taken place, the procedure is as follows. The replacement of the registration process by a written consultation is first announced by a 15-day prior public notice. The ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation recommends that this public notice   \tdescribe the project that would have been the subject of a register, but is instead subject to a call for written comments.specify the web address at which the proposed regulation or resolution is posted.indicate that any person may submit written comments, by email or regular mail, for a period of 15 days following publication of the notice.For non-priority projects, the municipality suspends the regulatory adoption process. In this case, the register will be opened once the health emergency has been lifted.  If the municipality does not receive a sufficient number of referendum applications, the regulatory adoption process continues (e.g., establishment of compliance by the regional county municipality). Any use or activity aimed at controlling the spread of COVID-19 or similar measures (e.g., temporary hospitals, screening centres) are exempt from the process of amending urban planning by-laws. During a health emergency, the Minister of Health and Social Services has the power to order the construction of any work or the installation of facilities for health purposes or the provision of health and social services. To do so, the minister is not required to comply with the regulations in force.Borrowing regulations, credit commitments, and creation of financial reserves For these projects, the municipality cannot undertake a registration process for qualified voters and referendum voting during a health emergency. As is normally the case, qualified voters cannot apply for these types of projects. However, in order to determine the applicable procedure, the municipality must first determine, by resolution requiring the support of two-thirds of the members of council, whether the project is a priority. For projects deemed a priority, the municipality will hold a written consultation. This consultation replaces the referendum process and no register is then opened. The procedure is as follows. The replacement of the registration process by a written consultation is first announced by a 15-day prior public notice. The ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation recommends that this public notice  \tdescribe the project that would have been the subject of a register, but is instead subject to a call for written comments.specify the web address where a detailed presentation of the project is posted.indicate that any person may submit written comments, by email or regular mail, for a period of 15 days following publication of the notice. \t\t For projects deemed to be non-priority, the municipality will suspend the regulatory adoption process. In this case, the register will be opened once the health emergency has been lifted.  For all borrowing by-laws, regardless of the applicable procedure (priority project or project exempted from the referendum approval process), the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing must approve them, as is normally the case.Municipal territorial organization – The Act respecting  municipal territorial organization provides for the possibility of referendum approval processes in certain situations (municipal groupings, name change, change of regime, territorial annexation, attachment to a regional county municipality, etc.).  However, this process occurs only if the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing so orders, on the date stipulated by the latter. During a health emergency, if such a referendum process were to be ordered, it would not be held until the health emergency is lifted. The process would therefore be suspended until further notice.",

However, under order 2020-008 of March 22, 2020, any procedure involving the movement or gathering of citizens that is part of the decision-making process of a municipal body is suspended or replaced. The council determines whether the public meeting is to be suspended or replaced. However, with respect to the process of division into electoral districts, the council is not required to exercise this choice at the stage of the adoption of the draft by-law or at the stage of the adoption of the by-law. In fact, in the event that the required number of notices of objection is not reached, the process can continue in accordance with the requirements of the AERM, which should allow the deadline for the adoption of the by-law to be met, specifically before June 1, 2020.  However, if the required number of notices of objection is reached, either at the draft by-law stage (s. 18) or at the by-law stage (s. 25), the municipality must decide whether to postpone the process of territorial division into electoral districts (suspension) or to replace the meeting provided for in the AERM with a written consultation (replacement).  Suspension - If the required number of notices of objection is reached at either the draft by-law stage (s. 18) or the by-law stage (s. 25), the council may decide to suspend the public meeting. In this case, the municipality should announce this by a public notice of postponement indicating that a new public notice announcing the holding of the meeting will be given after the end of the health emergency. In such circumstances, the process of division into electoral districts is suspended until further notice. Municipalities that decide to defer their by-law to divide into electoral districts should contact the ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation to inform it of this decision. Replacement - If the required number of notices of objection is reached, either at the draft by-law stage (s. 18) or at the by-law stage (s. 25), the council may decide that the process of division into electoral districts should continue. In this case, it must designate this as a priority by a two-thirds majority vote. The consultation meeting is then replaced by a written consultation announced 15 days in advance by a public notice. This has the effect of cancelling the holding of a public consultation meeting. The Ministère recommends that this public notice   describe the draft by-law or by-law for the division into electoral districts.specify the Web address at which a detailed presentation of the draft by-law or by-law for division into electoral districts is posted. indicate that any person may submit written comments, by email or regular mail, for a period of 15 days following publication of the notice. However, given the isolation in which citizens find themselves, the ministère des Affaires municipales et de l'Habitation suggests that municipalities postpone (suspend) the procedure for dividing into electoral districts when the number of citizens provided for by law is opposed to it. Municipalities that decide to defer their by-law on division into electoral districts should contact the Ministère to inform it of their decision.",

The interactive form costs nothing to use, and is simple and quick to complete. Simply enter your data, and the calculation will be carried out automatically. Before adjusting the amount of child support payable, if you’ve lost your job, for instance, it would be best to know the amounts to which you will be entitled in order to determine your income.  The child support payment amount can also include costs related to children, for example daycare costs. Since parents will not have to cover these costs during the pandemic whether or not they are entitled to emergency daycare services, they may be taken into account when reviewing the support payable, but only for the period during which these fees are waived.  Educational childcare services will be free for parents who are essential service workers, which entitles them to emergency daycare services. Parents’ contributions will be covered by the Ministère de la Famille. Parents who can no longer use educational childcare services during the public health emergency will no longer have to pay childcare costs.

Adherence to good food hygiene and safety practices and safe cooking generally minimizes the risk of transmission of any foodborne contamination and illness. Food establishment operators (restaurants, supermarkets, slaughterhouses, butchers, dairy plants, processing plants, etc.) play an important role in preventing foodborne illnesses. In the current context, they should follow public health recommendations and the following guidelines: Ensure that staff under their responsibility are aware of issues related to COVID19;Rest assured that the staff respect the rigorous sanitary guidelines recommended by the public health authorities;Ensure that food handlers are properly trained in food hygiene practices;Ensure effective supervision of food handlers to enhance hygiene practices in the establishment;Ensure that the appropriate facilities are available for hand washing;Ensure that food handlers are aware that they must report any symptoms of respiratory illness before or during work;Ensure that food handlers and other personnel are not ill;Ensure that staff with symptoms remain at home until medical advice is received;Enhance cleaning and sanitation procedures for items that are exposed to public handling (handles, crates, counters, menus, etc.). Special attention should be paid to fast food or self-service locations where utensils can be handled by several people;The use of self-service buffets where people have to wait in line, close to each other and close to food and utensils, is an increased risk and should be avoided;Provide for additional or alternative refrigerated or frozen storage capacities to meet the food demand, which is likely subject to change (decreased demand in the hotel, restaurant and institutional sectors, increased demand for food products at retail locations);Prepare an action plan in the event of a labour shortage. Do not neglect cleaning and sanitation activities and processing methods that require qualifications. If necessary, prioritize activities that ensure the best means of food availability and abandon other activities. The Public health expertise and reference centre (INSPQ) has produced a series of documents outlining preventative measures to take against the spread of COVID-19 in different work environments , with some of those pertaining to the food industry. ",

Confirm with your suppliers how effective their cleaning and sanitizing procedures and products are against coronavirus. In case of doubt, it is best to keep the procedures already in place and always ensure that they are correctly applied, in accordance with manufacturer instructions. For non-food surfaces that are particularly exposed to the public (handles, crates, counters, etc.), more frequent cleaning using a disinfection method known to be effective against coronavirus is recommended.

The list of essential services and activities  is updated continuously and will remain in effect until May 4, 2020, subject to changes made by the government. Businesses are encouraged to refer to it regularly. Regarding public health, horticultural producers are encouraged to follow the directives of the National Public Health Institute of Québec (INSPQ) relating to agricultural businesses.  ",
