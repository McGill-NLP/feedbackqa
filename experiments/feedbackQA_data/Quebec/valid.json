It is important to remember that collective agreements in the municipal sector remain applicable in the context of a health emergency. The flexibilities required to take the situation into account must therefore be discussed with the associations and unions. Despite the obligation to adopt a balanced budget, a municipality cannot base a decision to lay off employees on the illegality of running a deficit during the year. Indeed, the law expressly provides for mechanisms to enable municipalities to run deficits. The decision to proceed with layoffs is therefore a matter of municipal policy considerations rather than the application of legal provisions.",

Nevertheless, citizens could submit requests to the municipality to open a register. Here are some additional indications, depending on the situation.Planning and development - For draft by-laws under the Act respecting land use planning and development, the municipality may not proceed with the registration of qualified voters and the referendum process during a health emergency. However, qualified voters may submit applications for referendums. These applications may be forwarded to the municipality individually, rather than by petition, to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The public notice announcing that provisions are subject to referendum approval could invite qualified voters to transmit their requests in this way.  If it receives a sufficient number of requests, the municipality must first determine, by resolution requiring the support of two-thirds of council members, whether the project is a priority.  For projects deemed a priority, the municipality will hold a written consultation identical to the one planned as an alternative to public consultation meetings. This consultation replaces the referendum process and no register is then opened. If it has already held such a written consultation to replace the meeting provided for in the Act, it does not have to repeat it and the regulatory adoption process continues. If such a consultation has not previously taken place, the procedure is as follows. The replacement of the registration process by a written consultation is first announced by a 15-day prior public notice. The ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation recommends that this public notice   \tdescribe the project that would have been the subject of a register, but is instead subject to a call for written comments.specify the web address at which the proposed regulation or resolution is posted.indicate that any person may submit written comments, by email or regular mail, for a period of 15 days following publication of the notice.For non-priority projects, the municipality suspends the regulatory adoption process. In this case, the register will be opened once the health emergency has been lifted.  If the municipality does not receive a sufficient number of referendum applications, the regulatory adoption process continues (e.g., establishment of compliance by the regional county municipality). Any use or activity aimed at controlling the spread of COVID-19 or similar measures (e.g., temporary hospitals, screening centres) are exempt from the process of amending urban planning by-laws. During a health emergency, the Minister of Health and Social Services has the power to order the construction of any work or the installation of facilities for health purposes or the provision of health and social services. To do so, the minister is not required to comply with the regulations in force.Borrowing regulations, credit commitments, and creation of financial reserves For these projects, the municipality cannot undertake a registration process for qualified voters and referendum voting during a health emergency. As is normally the case, qualified voters cannot apply for these types of projects. However, in order to determine the applicable procedure, the municipality must first determine, by resolution requiring the support of two-thirds of the members of council, whether the project is a priority. For projects deemed a priority, the municipality will hold a written consultation. This consultation replaces the referendum process and no register is then opened. The procedure is as follows. The replacement of the registration process by a written consultation is first announced by a 15-day prior public notice. The ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation recommends that this public notice  \tdescribe the project that would have been the subject of a register, but is instead subject to a call for written comments.specify the web address where a detailed presentation of the project is posted.indicate that any person may submit written comments, by email or regular mail, for a period of 15 days following publication of the notice. \t\t For projects deemed to be non-priority, the municipality will suspend the regulatory adoption process. In this case, the register will be opened once the health emergency has been lifted.  For all borrowing by-laws, regardless of the applicable procedure (priority project or project exempted from the referendum approval process), the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing must approve them, as is normally the case.Municipal territorial organization – The Act respecting  municipal territorial organization provides for the possibility of referendum approval processes in certain situations (municipal groupings, name change, change of regime, territorial annexation, attachment to a regional county municipality, etc.).  However, this process occurs only if the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing so orders, on the date stipulated by the latter. During a health emergency, if such a referendum process were to be ordered, it would not be held until the health emergency is lifted. The process would therefore be suspended until further notice.",

This includes wearing a mask and paying special attention to hand washing before providing care. Comply with the usual hygiene measures for contact with animals. These measures are found in the Maladies animales transmissibles à l'humain  section (french only).Avoid contact between your animal and other animals or with people.If someone else must take care of the animal, choose a household member if possible. Brief this person on the measures to apply, especially those concerning limited contact with the animal, hand washing before and after care is provided, and disinfecting the environment that must be shared with the animal, where applicable (e.g. for walks, etc.). Also remind the person about the hygiene measures to follow. Animal breeders already use good biosecurity and hygiene. They are urged to enhance it if needed.",

You can also find out about community gardens. To get started, consult the Guide de l'agriculture urbaine .If you like the idea of keeping urban chickens (poules en ville ) or any other animal species, never act on a whim. Chickens , like all other farm animals, require constant care to ensure their welfare. This type of farming is sometimes permitted by municipalities, you must be well informed before embarking on such a project, particularly with regard to the applicable regulations, the animals’ specific needs, and the availability of veterinary care in your region for the species you intend to keep. Before you start planning, you can consult the Guide de l'agriculture urbaine .",

The Québec and Canadian governments are taking various measures to minimize the impact of the pandemic on each individual’s financial situation.

The interactive form costs nothing to use, and is simple and quick to complete. Simply enter your data, and the calculation will be carried out automatically. Before adjusting the amount of child support payable, if you’ve lost your job, for instance, it would be best to know the amounts to which you will be entitled in order to determine your income.  The child support payment amount can also include costs related to children, for example daycare costs. Since parents will not have to cover these costs during the pandemic whether or not they are entitled to emergency daycare services, they may be taken into account when reviewing the support payable, but only for the period during which these fees are waived.  Educational childcare services will be free for parents who are essential service workers, which entitles them to emergency daycare services. Parents’ contributions will be covered by the Ministère de la Famille. Parents who can no longer use educational childcare services during the public health emergency will no longer have to pay childcare costs.
