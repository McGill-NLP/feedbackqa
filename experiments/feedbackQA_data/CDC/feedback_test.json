Hospitalization rates are updated weekly. COVID-NET\nalso provides important clinical information on COVID-19-associated\nhospitalizations, including age group, sex, race/ethnicity and underlying\nhealth conditions.\nHospitalization Rates\nPatient Characteristics\nCOVID-NET Data Collection, Timeliness and Interpretation\nCases are identified in COVID-NET if they test positive for SARS-COV-2 (the\nvirus that causes COVID-19 disease) through a test ordered by a health care\nprofessional and are hospitalized within 14 days of the positive test.\nClinical data are collected using a standardized case reporting form by\ntrained surveillance officers, so the data are collected in a standardized and\nuniform way.\nCOVID-NET is expected to collect the following data for each case:\n\nage\nsex\nsurveillance site\ndate of hospital admission\nevidence of positive SARS-CoV-2 test\ndemographic information (e.g., race, ethnicity)\nclinical (medical) history (underlying health conditions)\nclinical course (progression of the illness such as admission to an intensive care unit)\nmedical interventions (medical care for the illness such as need for mechanical ventilation)\noutcomes (e.g., released from the hospital, death)\n\nHow COVID-NET Hospitalization Data Is Different from Hospitalizations\nReported in National and State Case Counts\nCOVID-NET differs from hospitalizations reported in national and state case\ncounts in two ways. First, state and national COVID-19 case reporting are\nbased on all people who test positive for COVID-19 in the United States.\nCOVID-NET is limited to COVID-19-associated hospitalizations captured in the\nCOVID-NET surveillance area. Second, COVID-NET reports rates and not just\ncounts. These rates show how many people are hospitalized with COVID-19 in the\nsurveillance area, compared to the entire number of people residing in that\narea.\nHow COVID-NET Calculates Hospitalization Rates\nHospitalization rates are calculated by the number of residents of a defined\narea who are hospitalized with a positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test divided\nby the total population within that defined area.\nCOVID-NET coverage\nCOVID-NET comprises 99 counties in the 14 states participating in the\nEmerging Infections Program (EIP) and the\nInfluenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP). Participating states\ninclude: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan,\nMinnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, and Utah.\nCOVID-NET covers approximately 10 percent of the U.S. population. The counties\ncovered are located in all 10 Health and Human Services (HHS)\nregions.\nThe designated COVID-NET surveillance area is generally similar to the U.S.\npopulation by demographics; however, the information might not be\ngeneralizable to the entire country.\nAccessing COVID-NET Data\nCOVID-19-associated hospitalization rates are reported to CDC on a weekly\nbasis. COVID-NET data, including hospitalization rates for different age\ngroups and data on\npatient characteristics,\nare available on COVIDView \nCOVID-NET hospitalization data are preliminary and may change as more data\nis received. In particular, case counts and rates for recent hospital\nadmissions are subject to lag. As data are received each week, prior case\ncounts and rates are updated accordingly.\nCOVID-NET Publications\n\nStudy: Hospitalization Rates and Characteristics of Patients Hospitalized with Laboratory-Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 – COVID-NET, 14 States, March 1-30, 2020.

COVID-NET\nalso provides important clinical information on COVID-19-associated\nhospitalizations, including age group, sex, race/ethnicity and underlying\nhealth conditions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19_3.html\">Hospitalization Rates</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19_5.html\">Patient Characteristics</a></p>\n<h3>COVID-NET Data Collection, Timeliness and Interpretation</h3>\n<p>Cases are identified in COVID-NET if they test positive for SARS-COV-2 (the\nvirus that causes COVID-19 disease) through a test ordered by a health care\nprofessional and are hospitalized within 14 days of the positive test.\nClinical data are collected using a standardized case reporting form by\ntrained surveillance officers, so the data are collected in a standardized and\nuniform way.</p>\n<p>COVID-NET is expected to collect the following data for each case:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>age</li>\n<li>sex</li>\n<li>surveillance site</li>\n<li>date of hospital admission</li>\n<li>evidence of positive SARS-CoV-2 test</li>\n<li>demographic information (e.g., race, ethnicity)</li>\n<li>clinical (medical) history (underlying health conditions)</li>\n<li>clinical course (progression of the illness such as admission to an intensive care unit)</li>\n<li>medical interventions (medical care for the illness such as need for mechanical ventilation)</li>\n<li>outcomes (e.g., released from the hospital, death)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How COVID-NET Hospitalization Data Is Different from Hospitalizations</h3>\n<p>Reported in National and State Case Counts</p>\n<p>COVID-NET differs from hospitalizations reported in national and state case\ncounts in two ways. First, state and national COVID-19 case reporting are\nbased on all people who test positive for COVID-19 in the United States.\nCOVID-NET is limited to COVID-19-associated hospitalizations captured in the\nCOVID-NET surveillance area. Second, COVID-NET reports rates and not just\ncounts. These rates show how many people are hospitalized with COVID-19 in the\nsurveillance area, compared to the entire number of people residing in that\narea.</p>\n<h3>How COVID-NET Calculates Hospitalization Rates</h3>\n<p>Hospitalization rates are calculated by the number of residents of a defined\narea who are hospitalized with a positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test divided\nby the total population within that defined area.</p>\n<h4>COVID-NET coverage</h4>\n<p>COVID-NET comprises 99 counties in the 14 states participating in the\n<a href=\"/ncezid/dpei/eip/index.html\">Emerging Infections Program (EIP)</a> and the\nInfluenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP). Participating states\ninclude: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan,\nMinnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, and Utah.</p>\n<p>COVID-NET covers approximately 10 percent of the U.S. population. The counties\ncovered are located in all 10 <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/iea/regional-offices/index.html\">Health and Human Services (HHS)\nregions</a>.\nThe designated COVID-NET surveillance area is generally similar to the U.S.\npopulation by demographics; however, the information might not be\ngeneralizable to the entire country.</p>\n<h3>Accessing COVID-NET Data</h3>\n<p>COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates are reported to CDC on a weekly\nbasis. COVID-NET data, including <a href=\"https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19_3.html\">hospitalization rates for different age\ngroups</a> and <a href=\"https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19_5.html\">data on\npatient characteristics</a>,\nare available on <a href=\"/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-\ndata/covidview/index.html\">COVIDView </a></p>\n<p><strong>COVID-NET hospitalization data are preliminary and may change as more data\nis received.</strong> In particular, case counts and rates for recent hospital\nadmissions are subject to lag. As data are received each week, prior case\ncounts and rates are updated accordingly.</p>\n<h3>COVID-NET Publications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Study: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6915e3.htm\">Hospitalization Rates and Characteristics of Patients Hospitalized with Laboratory-Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 – COVID-NET, 14 States, March 1-30, 2020.</a> MMWR Morb Mortal Wklyl Rep 2020; 69:458-464</li>\n</ul>"

This plan should be shared with you and your\ncoworkers. Employers should:\nReduce transmission among employees\n\nTake steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 if a driver is sick. \nActively encourage sick drivers to stay home.\nSick drivers diagnosed with COVID-19 shouldn’t return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments.\n\n\nProvide drivers with accurate information about COVID-19, how it spreads, and risk of exposure. \nBe aware that some drivers may be at higher risk for serious illness, such as older adults and those with chronic medical conditions. Put in place specific policies to minimize face-to-face contact between these drivers, or assign work tasks that allow them to maintain a distance of six feet from other workers, customers, and visitors.\nProvide training to drivers on proper handwashing practices and other routine preventative measures. This will help prevent the spread of many diseases, including COVID-19.\n\n\nProvide drivers with all PPE (including vests, safety glasses, hard hats) that they might need while on the road so that the driver does not need to borrow PPE from shippers.\nProvide alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol for truck cabs.\nProvide tissues and small trash cans for truck cabs.\nTake additional precautions to address risks associated with ride-alongs or team driving (two drivers in the cab on a long-haul run) when they cannot be avoided. For example, install a removable barrier between the driver and passenger that does not obstruct the task of driving and/or to separate sleeper berth.\n\nMaintain a healthy work environment\n\nConduct worksite assessments to identify COVID-19 prevention strategies.\nInstitute measures to physically separate and increase distance between drivers, other coworkers, and customers, such as: \nDevelop policies and technology options that allow and encourage contactless deliveries, such as no-signature delivery. These options limit contact, provide space, and avoid the sharing of items like pens and electronic signature pads between drivers and individuals at the delivery location.\nDuring driver training situations, use virtual training methods and in-vehicle monitoring systems where possible. Limit ride-alongs and in-person classroom-based training. Follow all applicable federal motor carrier regulations and public health agency guidelines.\n\n\nPlace posters that encourage staying home when sick, cough and sneeze etiquette, and proper hand hygiene practices on the dock and in other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen.\nProvide disposable disinfectant wipes so that surfaces commonly touched can be wiped down. To disinfect, use products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2external icon, diluted household bleach solutions, or alcohol solutions with at least 60% alcohol, and are appropriate for the surface. Provide drivers training on manufacturer’s directions for use; more detailed cleaning and disinfecting guidance is also availableexternal icon.\nPre-qualify truck stops, rest areas, and hotels to ensure such facilities are open, supplied, and follow recommended COVID-19 safety practices, such as: \ncleanliness and disinfection (such as routine cleaning, available hand-sanitizing stations, and private showers);\nproper food handling and food service (such as replacing self-service with full service);\ncontactless fuel payment.\n\n\nFollow all applicable local, state, and federal regulations and public health agency guidelines.\n\nMaintain healthy business operations\n\nFollow the CDC guidance for critical infrastructure workers who may have had exposure to a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. \nReintegrating exposed, asymptomatic workers back to work, while discussed in the guidance, should not be misinterpreted as the first or most appropriate option.\nHome isolation may still be the most preferred and viable option for exposed workers.\n\n\nDesignate a person who is responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. Drivers should know who this person is and how to contact them.\nConsider using a hotline for employees to voice concerns anonymously.\nMake a plan with your employees as to what to do if they become sick while on the road. Include where to stop, where and how to seek medical advice and treatment, and plans for freight delivery.\nImplement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices. Consider drafting non-punitive emergency sick leave policies if sick leave is not offered to some or all employees. Employers should not require a positive COVID-19 test result or a healthcare provider’s note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick leave, or to return to work.\nProvide information on who to contact if employees become sick. If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19 infection, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace, but maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\nReach out to local public health officials to establish ongoing communications to facilitate access to relevant information before and during a local outbreak.\nSchedule driver routes to allow for adequate sleep, and use fatigue management strategies.\nUnderstand that the current environment could elevate stress levels among drivers. Provide resources to help manage stress.\n",

Employers should:</p>\n<p><strong>Reduce transmission among employees</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html\">steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 if </a>a driver is sick. <ul>\n<li>Actively encourage sick drivers to stay home.</li>\n<li>Sick drivers diagnosed with COVID-19 shouldn’t return to work until <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html\">the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met</a>, in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Provide drivers with accurate information about COVID-19, how it spreads, and risk of exposure. <ul>\n<li>Be aware that some drivers may be at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html\">higher risk</a> for serious illness, such as older adults and those with chronic medical conditions. Put in place specific policies to minimize face-to-face contact between these drivers, or assign work tasks that allow them to maintain a distance of six feet from other workers, customers, and visitors.</li>\n<li>Provide training to drivers on proper <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html\">handwashing</a> practices and other routine preventative measures. This will help prevent the spread of many diseases, including COVID-19.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Provide drivers with all PPE (including vests, safety glasses, hard hats) that they might need while on the road so that the driver does not need to borrow PPE from shippers.</li>\n<li>Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol for truck cabs.</li>\n<li>Provide tissues and small trash cans for truck cabs.</li>\n<li>Take additional precautions to address risks associated with ride-alongs or team driving (two drivers in the cab on a long-haul run) when they cannot be avoided. For example, install a removable barrier between the driver and passenger that does not obstruct the task of driving and/or to separate sleeper berth.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Maintain a healthy work environment</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conduct worksite assessments to identify COVID-19 prevention strategies.</li>\n<li>Institute measures to physically separate and increase distance between drivers, other coworkers, and customers, such as: <ul>\n<li>Develop policies and technology options that allow and encourage contactless deliveries, such as no-signature delivery. These options limit contact, provide space, and avoid the sharing of items like pens and electronic signature pads between drivers and individuals at the delivery location.</li>\n<li>During driver training situations, use virtual training methods and in-vehicle monitoring systems where possible. Limit ride-alongs and in-person classroom-based training. Follow all applicable federal motor carrier regulations and public health agency guidelines.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Place posters that encourage <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nonpharmaceutical-interventions/tools-resources/educational-materials.html\">staying home when sick</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/etiquette/coughing_sneezing.html\">cough and sneeze etiquette</a>, and proper <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/materials.html\">hand hygiene</a> practices on the dock and in other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen.</li>\n<li>Provide disposable disinfectant wipes so that surfaces commonly touched can be wiped down. To disinfect, use <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2\">products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2external icon</a>, diluted household bleach solutions, or alcohol solutions with at least 60% alcohol, and are appropriate for the surface. Provide drivers training on manufacturer’s directions for use; more detailed cleaning and disinfecting guidance is also <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/guidance-cleaning-and-disinfecting-public-spaces-workplaces-businesses-schools-and-homes\">availableexternal icon</a>.</li>\n<li>Pre-qualify truck stops, rest areas, and hotels to ensure such facilities are open, supplied, and follow recommended COVID-19 safety practices, such as: <ul>\n<li>cleanliness and disinfection (such as routine cleaning, available hand-sanitizing stations, and private showers);</li>\n<li>proper food handling and food service (such as replacing self-service with full service);</li>\n<li>contactless fuel payment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Follow all applicable local, state, and federal regulations and public health agency guidelines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Maintain healthy business operations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow the CDC guidance for <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/critical-workers/implementing-safety-practices.html\">critical infrastructure workers who may have had exposure to a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19</a>. <ul>\n<li>Reintegrating exposed, asymptomatic workers back to work, while discussed in the guidance, should not be misinterpreted as the first or most appropriate option.</li>\n<li>Home isolation may still be the most preferred and viable option for exposed workers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Designate a person who is responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. Drivers should know who this person is and how to contact them.</li>\n<li>Consider using a hotline for employees to voice concerns anonymously.</li>\n<li>Make a plan with your employees as to what to do if they become sick while on the road. Include where to stop, where and how to seek medical advice and treatment, and plans for freight delivery.</li>\n<li>Implement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices. Consider drafting non-punitive emergency sick leave policies if sick leave is not offered to some or all employees. Employers should not require a positive COVID-19 test result or a healthcare provider’s note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick leave, or to return to work.</li>\n<li>Provide information on who to contact if employees become sick. If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19 infection, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace, but maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).</li>\n<li>Reach out to local public health officials to establish ongoing communications to facilitate access to relevant information before and during a local outbreak.</li>\n<li>Schedule driver routes to allow for adequate sleep, and use <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/motorvehicle/topics/driverfatigue/default.html\">fatigue management strategies</a>.</li>\n<li>Understand that the current environment could elevate stress levels among drivers. Provide resources to help manage stress.</li>\n</ul>"

Disease can\nspread between ships when crew members from a ship with an outbreak transfer\nto other ships. Infected people may also travel on cruise ships between\ncountries. For these reasons, outbreaks of COVID-19 on cruise ships pose a\nrisk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage and into communities across\nthe globe.\nBecause of the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the high risk\nof COVID-19 spread on cruise ships, the US government issued a No Sail Order\nfor cruise ships in waters subject to US jurisdiction and has advised US\ntravelers to defer all cruise\ntravel.\nThe No Sail Order is published in the Federal\nRegister.\nCDC continues to work to control COVID-19 on cruise ships at sea while also\nprotecting against further introduction and spread of COVID-19 into\ncommunities. The COVID-19 pandemic is constantly evolving, and aggressive\nefforts are needed to contain the spread. CDC will continue to evaluate and\nupdate our recommendations as the situation evolves.\nWhat is the No Sail Order?\nIn response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and the increased risk of\nspread of COVID-19 on cruise ships, CDC published the first industry-wide No\nSail Order on March 14 to\nprevent, among other things, new passengers from boarding cruise ships. CDC\nextended its No Sail Order, effective April 15, 2020, to continue to suspend\nall cruise ship operations in waters subject to US jurisdiction. Among other\nthings, cruise lines are required to develop comprehensive plans to prevent,\ndetect, respond to, and contain COVID-19 on their cruise ships to protect the\nhealth and safety of both passengers and crew.\nHow long is the No Sail Order in effect?\nThe extended Order is in effect until one of the following occurs:\n\nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services declares that COVID-19 no longer constitutes a public health emergency, or\nThe CDC Director rescinds or modifies the order based on specific public health or other considerations, or\n100 days have passed from April 15, the date the extended order was published in the Federal Register and went into effect. 100 days from April 15 is July 24.\n\nWhy did CDC extend the No Sail Order?\nThe No Sail Order was extended to protect the public, cruise ship passengers,\ncruise ship crews, and other industry workers. By restricting cruise ship\npassenger operations, the Order helps achieve several public health goals:\n\nPrevents further spread of COVID-19 into and within the United States\nPreserves critical federal, state, and local resources that are needed to respond to COVID-19\nPreserves critical healthcare, emergency, and port resources\n\nWhat cruise ships does the No Sail Order cover?\nThe No Sail Order applies to all cruise ships, which it defines as commercial\npassenger ships with the capacity to carry more than 250 people and where an\novernight stay onboard by passengers or crew is anticipated. The Order applies\nto all cruise ships operating, or seeking to operate, in waters subject to US\njurisdiction, including those that have previously voluntarily suspended\noperations. It does not apply to cargo ships.\nWhat does the No Sail Order mean for my upcoming trip?\nPassengers who plan to travel by cruise ship should contact their cruise line\ncompanies directly for further information.\nOn March 17, 2020, CDC issued a Level 3 travel health\nnotice\nwith a clear recommendation to avoid all cruise travel due to ongoing spread\nof COVID-19 and the increased risk of person-to-person spread of infectious\ndiseases on cruise ships. The No Sail Order suspends all cruise ship\noperations in waters subject to US jurisdiction.\nWhat is CDC doing to help cruise ships with crew still on board?\nWe are currently in a phase of the pandemic where it is necessary to implement\nstrict measures to control the spread of COVID-19. Just as the American public\nhas a role to play in practicing social distancing, cruise lines have a role\nto play in properly caring for their crew, including making sure they can\npractice social distancing, isolating them if they are sick, and quarantining\nthem if they have been exposed to COVID-19.\nCDC is committed to the safety and well-being of crew members while onboard\nand as they disembark. CDC is allowing crew members to disembark from cruise\nships in U.S. waters and return home if cruise lines submit a signed\nattestation stating that they\nhave complied with requirements to safely disembark their crew members. Crew\nmembers who remain onboard and want to disembark should contact their cruise\nship or cruise line about meeting CDC requirements for safe disembarkation and\ntransport. A list of disembarkations that CDC has approved is available\nhere.\nCrew members on ships in or intending to be in US waters who have questions\nabout the process for disembarkation or who have concerns about what their\nship is doing to prevent COVID-19 onboard can share their questions or\nconcerns with CDC by sending an email to\neocevent431@cdc.gov.\nCruise ships have medical facilities on board that can provide medical care to\nsick crew members as needed. As part of their cruise ship plans, cruise lines\nshould make sure they have enough medical staff, equipment, supplies, and\nother resources to provide care for sick people on board. They also need a\nplan to transfer sick crew members to a hospital on land if they need medical\ncare that the ship’s medical facility can’t provide.\nCDC and federal partners are monitoring ships with crew only, and we are\nworking with the cruise companies and local and state health departments to\nensure that seriously ill crew members can get medical assistance on land if\nthe ship can’t provide it. CDC remains committed to humanitarian medical\nevacuation for people in need of lifesaving support. Emergency medical\nevacuations do not require CDC approval.\nWhat is CDC doing to help cruise ships with passengers still on board?\nA small number of passengers are still aboard cruise ships in and around US\nwaters. These passengers are awaiting repatriation to their home countries.\nCDC is working with partners as part of the Unified Command, including Coast\nGuard, Customs and Border Protection, port authorities, local and state health\ndepartments, and Department of State, along with cruise lines, to help\nremaining cruise ship passengers get home as quickly and safely as possible.\nThese are cruise ships that had international voyages with U.S. ports, and\ntherefore are under CDC jurisdiction. International voyages without U.S. ports\nof call are not under CDC jurisdiction and not included.\nInternational cruise voyages with U.S. domestic ports of call have been\nsuspended since March 14, 2020, under CDC’s No Sail\nOrder.

Be sure to alert your veterinarian if your pet has trouble breathing, or if you think it is an emergency.\nWhile most pets appear to show only mild symptoms or no symptoms, we are still learning about how they are affected by the virus. Even if your pet appears to be feeling better, avoid the following activities until your veterinarian determines that it is safe for your pet to do so or your pet has met the guidance to end their isolation: \nVisits to veterinary hospitals, without calling the veterinarian first\nVisits to human healthcare facilities or schools\nVisits to parks (including dog parks), markets, or other gatherings such as festivals\nVisits to the groomer, including mobile grooming salons\nVisits to pet daycares or boarding facilities\nOther outings such as playdates, hikes, or visiting other homes, with or without pets\nUsing dog walkers or pet-sitters that live outside your home\n\n\n\nSeparate your pet from other people and pets in your home\n\n\nHave the pet stay in a designated “sick room” (such as a laundry room or extra bathroom) if possible, or otherwise be separated from people and other animals. This is the same way a person with COVID-19 would separate from others in their household.\n\n\nAvoid contact with the pet as much as possible, including, petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food or bedding.\n\nIf possible, provide a separate litterbox or bathroom area from other pets.\n\nDOGS: If you have a private backyard where your dog can go to the bathroom, do\nnot take them for walks. If you must walk your dog, limit it to bathroom\nbreaks only, stay close to your home, and keep your pet at least 6 feet away\nfrom other pets and people. Do not let other people touch or interact with\nyour dog.\nCATS: Cats should be kept inside. Do not allow cats that have tested positive\nfor the virus that causes COVID-19 to roam outside.\nCLEANING UP: There is no evidence to suggest that waste from infected pets\nneeds any additional disinfection. Wear gloves when cleaning up after your\npet, and place fecal material or litterbox waste in a sealed bag before\ndisposing.

Your veterinarian may\nhave you keep a written log of your pet’s symptoms.\nIf your pet develops new symptoms or seems to be getting worse, including\ntrouble breathing, you should call your veterinarian right away. Your\nveterinarian may be able to advise you over the phone or may tell you to bring\nyour pet to their clinic or go to another clinic that can better care for your\npet.\nProtect yourself when caring for a sick pet\n\nFollow similar recommended precautions as for people caring for an infected person at home.\nIf you are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, another household member should care for the pet, if possible.\nPeople should wear a cloth face covering and gloves in the same room or area as the sick pet. \nAnimals should not wear a cloth face covering or mask. Do not try to put a cloth face covering on your pet.\n\n\nUse gloves when handling the pet’s dishes, toys, or bedding and when picking up feces (poop). Throw out gloves and place waste material or litterbox waste in a sealed bag before throwing away in a trashcan lined with a trash bag. Always wash your hands with soap and water immediately after cleaning up after your pet.\nClean your hands regularly throughout the day. \nWash hands: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds each Make sure everyone in the home does the same, especially after touching the sick pet or handling their dishes, toys, or bedding.\nHand sanitizer: If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

Examples to consider\nthat incorporate these types of controls for temperature screening include:\n\nReliance on Social Distancing : Ask employees to take their own temperature either before coming to the workplace or upon arrival at the workplace. Upon their arrival, stand at least 6 feet away from the employee and: \nAsk the employee to confirm that their temperature is less than 100.4o F (38.0o C), and confirm that they are not experiencing coughing or shortness of breath.\nMake a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue.\nScreening staff do not need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) if they can maintain a distance of 6 feet.\n\n\nReliance on Barrier/Partition Controls : During screening, the screener stands behind a physical barrier, such as a glass or plastic window or partition, that can protect the screener’s face and mucous membranes from respiratory droplets that may be produced when the employee sneezes, coughs, or talks. Upon arrival, the screener should wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, if soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Then: \nMake a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue.\nConduct temperature and symptom screening using this protocol: \nPut on disposable gloves.\nCheck the employee’s temperature, reaching around the partition or through the window. Make sure the screener’s face stays behind the barrier at all times during the screening.\nIf performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, make sure that you use a clean pair of gloves for each employee and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check. If disposable or non-contact thermometers are used and you did not have physical contact with an individual, you do not need to change gloves before the next check. If non-contact thermometers are used, clean and disinfect them according to manufacturer’s instructions and facility policies.\nRemove and discard PPE (gloves), and wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\n\n\n\nIf social distance or barrier controls cannot be implemented during screening,\nPPE can be used when the screener is within 6 feet of an employee during\nscreening. However, reliance on PPE alone is a less effective control and more\ndifficult to implement given PPE shortages and training requirements.\n\nReliance on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) : Upon arrival, the screener should wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, put on a facemask, eye protection (goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face), and a single pair of disposable gloves. A gown could be considered if extensive contact with an employee is anticipated. Then: \nMake a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue, and confirm that the employee is not experiencing coughing or shortness of breath.\nTake the employee’s temperature. \nIf performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, make sure that you use a clean pair of gloves for each employee and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check.

Small construction businesses should review the\nCDC small business\nguidelines. Your employer should take steps to:\nReduce transmission among workers:\n\nTake steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 if an employee is sick. \nActively encourage sick employees to stay home.\nSick employees diagnosed with COVID-19 shouldn’t return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments.\n\n\nProvide employees with accurate information (in a language they understand) about COVID-19, how it spreads, and risk of exposure. \nProvide workers with basic facts.\nConduct toolbox talks on all job sites to explain the protective measures in place.\n\n\nBe aware that some employees may be at higher risk for severe illness, such as older adults and those with underlying medical conditions. Implement specific policies to minimize face-to-face contact for these employees or assign work tasks that allow them to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from other workers, customers, and visitors, or to telework if possible.\nProvide training to employees on proper handwashing practices and other routine preventative measures. This will help prevent the spread of many diseases, including COVID-19.\nProvide employees with access to soap, clean running water, and materials for drying their hands, or if soap and water are not readily available provide alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol at stations around the establishment for use by both workers and customers. \nPlace handwashing stations and/or hand sanitizers in multiple locations (including in or adjacent to portable restrooms) to encourage hand hygiene.\n\n\nExplore alternative ways to promote hand hygiene if there is difficulty sourcing hand sanitizer and running water is not available on site. Some examples may include: \nInstall temporary or mobile handwashing stations, making sure there is an adequate supply of water, soap, and single-use paper towels.\nProvide a large (5+ gallon) bucket with a lid and tap that can be used to provide water for handwashing. If this method is used, the water tap should be regularly cleaned and disinfected, and the contaminated wastewater must be collected and treated in accordance with local laws and environmental regulations. Provide fresh clean water daily.\nDepending on the size or configuration of the job site, there may need to be multiple handwashing stations available to accommodate the workforce while maintaining social distancing, and stations may need to be restocked during the course of the day to maintain adequate handwashing supplies.\n\n\nDevelop and implement social distancing guidance for the workplace to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between workers when possible.\n\nMaintain a healthy work environment\n\nInstitute measures to physically separate and increase distance between employees, such as the following: \nModify work schedules to stagger work, provide alternating workdays or extra shifts to reduce the total number of workers on a job site at any given time.\nRestrict access to reduce the number of workers in enclosed and confined areas at one time. Confined and enclosed areas (e.g., trailers, small rooms in buildings under construction) should be identified and access should be restricted to essential personnel only. Enclosed spaces (e.g., toilets, break areas) are potential transmission areas and should be treated accordingly. Time spent in these areas should be minimized.\nRearrange administrative area workstations so that workers can stay at least 6 feet away from other workers.\nInstall shields or barriers, such as plexiglass barriers, where possible.\nRemove or rearrange chairs and tables or add visual cue marks in break areas to support social distancing practices between workers. Identify alternative areas to accommodate overflow volume.\nDisinfect break or lunchroom areas between each group using the areas.\nMaintain social distancing when visiting lunch trucks or construction site vendors.\nLimit casual (social) conversations that normally occur at work.\nCancel or postpone in-person meetings/trainings whenever possible. If you must meet, spread out to a distance of 6 feet or more between attendees.\nReduce the number of individuals at meetings, including worker orientations, to increase the distance between individuals.\n\n\nConduct a hazard assessment to determine if hazards are present, or are likely to be present, for which workers may need personal protective equipment (PPE). CDC and OSHA have recommended PPE for some types of work activities when engineering and administrative controls cannot be implemented or are not fully protective. \nEmployers are required to determine, select, provide, and train on correct PPE use and application for their workers’ specific job duties (see 29 CFR 1926 Subpart Eexternal icon).\n\n\nPlace posters that encourage staying home when sick, cough and sneeze etiquette, signs and symptoms of COVID-19, and proper hand hygiene practices at the entrance to the workplace and in other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen.\nProvide tissues and no-touch disposal receptacles for employees to use.\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. If the surfaces are visibly dirty, clean them prior to disinfecting. To disinfect, use products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2external icon, diluted household bleach solutions that are prepared according to the manufacturer’s label for disinfection, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, and that are appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer’s directions for use. \nClean workspaces and breakrooms at least once per shift or as often as workers change workstations.\nProvide worker training on manufacturer’s directions for disinfectant use and provide workers with any additional PPE required for disinfection.\n\n\nProvide disposable disinfectant wipes (when available) so that surfaces commonly touched can be wiped down.\nFollow all applicable local, state, and federal regulations and public health agency guidelines.\n\nMaintain healthy business operations\n\nDesignate a safety and health officer to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns at every jobsite. Workers should know who this person is and how to contact them.\nImplement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices. Consider drafting non-punitive emergency sick leave policies if sick leave is not offered to some or all employees. Employers should not require a positive COVID-19 test result or a healthcare provider’s note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick leave, or to return to work.\nProvide information on whom to contact if employees become sick. If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19 infection, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace but maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\nReach out to local public health officials to establish ongoing communications to facilitate access to relevant information before and during a local outbreak.\n",

To protect patients and co-workers, HCP should wear a facemask at\nall times while they are in a healthcare facility (i.e., practice source\ncontrol). Use of a facemask, instead of a cloth face covering, is recommended\nfor HCP, because a facemask offers both source control and protection from\nexposure to splashes and sprays of infectious material from others.\n\nHCP caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should continue to wear gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit-tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator (or facemask if respirators are not available), and eye protection (i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face).\n\nHCP working in facilities located in areas with moderate to substantial community transmission are more likely to encounter asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. If COVID-19 is not suspected in a patient presenting for care (based on symptom and exposure history), HCP should follow Standard Precautions (and Transmission-Based Precautions if required based on the suspected diagnosis). They should also: \n\nWear eye protection in addition to their facemask to ensure the eyes, nose, and mouth are all protected from splashes and sprays of infectious material from others.\nWear an N95 or higher-level respirator, instead of a facemask, for: \nAerosol-generating procedures (See Which procedures are considered aerosol generating procedures in healthcare settings FAQ) and\nSurgical procedures that might pose higher risk for transmission if the patient has COVID-19 (e.g., that generate potentially infectious aerosols or involving anatomic regions where viral loads might be higher, such as the nose and throat, oropharynx, respiratory tract) (see Surgical FAQ below).\nRespirators with exhalation valves are not recommended for source control and should not be used during surgical procedures as unfiltered exhaled breath would compromise the sterile field\n\n\n\nFor HCP working in areas with minimal to no community transmission, the universal eye protection and respirator recommendations (described above) for areas with moderate to substantial community transmission are optional. However, HCP should continue to use eye protection or an N95 or higher-level respirator whenever recommended for patient care as a part of Standard or Transmission-Based Precautions. Universal use of a facemask for source control is recommended for HCP.\n\n\nDepending on testing availability and how rapidly results are available,\nfacilities can also consider implementing pre-admission or pre-procedure\ntesting for COVID-19. Testing results might inform decisions for universal use\nof eye protection and respirators as described above, especially if there are\nPPE shortages.

If COVID-19 is not suspected in a patient presenting for care (based on symptom and exposure history), HCP should follow <a href=\"/hicpac/recommendations/core-practices.html\">Standard Precautions</a> (and <a href=\"/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/index.html\">Transmission-Based Precautions</a> if required based on the suspected diagnosis). They should also: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wear eye protection in addition to their facemask to ensure the eyes, nose, and mouth are all protected from splashes and sprays of infectious material from others.</li>\n<li>Wear an N95 or higher-level respirator, instead of a facemask, for: </li>\n<li>Aerosol-generating procedures (See Which procedures are considered aerosol generating procedures in healthcare settings FAQ) and</li>\n<li>Surgical procedures that might pose higher risk for transmission if the patient has COVID-19 (e.g., that generate potentially infectious aerosols or involving anatomic regions where viral loads might be higher, such as the nose and throat, oropharynx, respiratory tract) (see Surgical FAQ below).</li>\n<li>Respirators with exhalation valves are not recommended for source control and should not be used during surgical procedures as unfiltered exhaled breath would compromise the sterile field</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For HCP working in areas with minimal to no community transmission, the universal eye protection and respirator recommendations (described above) for areas with moderate to substantial community transmission are optional. However, HCP should continue to use eye protection or an N95 or higher-level respirator whenever recommended for patient care as a part of Standard or Transmission-Based Precautions. Universal use of a facemask for source control is recommended for HCP.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on testing availability and how rapidly results are available,\nfacilities can also consider implementing pre-admission or pre-procedure\ntesting for COVID-19. Testing results might inform decisions for universal use\nof eye protection and respirators as described above, especially if there are\nPPE shortages. Limitations of using this testing strategy include obtaining\nnegative results in patients during their incubation period who later become\ninfectious and false negative test results, depending on the test method used.</p>\n<p>Definitions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/framework-non-COVID-care.html\">Substantial community transmission</a>: Large scale community transmission, including communal settings (e.g., schools, workplaces)</li>\n<li>Minimal to moderate community transmission: Sustained transmission with high likelihood or confirmed exposure within communal settings and potential for rapid increase in cases</li>\n<li>No to minimal community transmission: Evidence of isolated cases or limited community transmission, case investigations underway; no evidence of exposure in large communal setting</li>\n</ul>"

                        "section_content": "Outbreaks of infectious diseases can happen on cruise ships because people\nspend time close together and with travelers from many countries. Disease can\nspread between ships when crew members from a ship with an outbreak transfer\nto other ships. Infected people may also travel on cruise ships between\ncountries. For these reasons, outbreaks of COVID-19 on cruise ships pose a\nrisk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage and into communities across\nthe globe.\nBecause of the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the high risk\nof COVID-19 spread on cruise ships, the US government issued a No Sail Order\nfor cruise ships in waters subject to US jurisdiction and has advised US\ntravelers to defer all cruise\ntravel.\nThe No Sail Order is published in the Federal\nRegister.\nCDC continues to work to control COVID-19 on cruise ships at sea while also\nprotecting against further introduction and spread of COVID-19 into\ncommunities. The COVID-19 pandemic is constantly evolving, and aggressive\nefforts are needed to contain the spread. CDC will continue to evaluate and\nupdate our recommendations as the situation evolves.\nWhat is the No Sail Order?\nIn response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and the increased risk of\nspread of COVID-19 on cruise ships, CDC published the first industry-wide No\nSail Order on March 14 to\nprevent, among other things, new passengers from boarding cruise ships. CDC\nextended its No Sail Order, effective April 15, 2020, to continue to suspend\nall cruise ship operations in waters subject to US jurisdiction. Among other\nthings, cruise lines are required to develop comprehensive plans to prevent,\ndetect, respond to, and contain COVID-19 on their cruise ships to protect the\nhealth and safety of both passengers and crew.\nHow long is the No Sail Order in effect?\nThe extended Order is in effect until one of the following occurs:\n\nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services declares that COVID-19 no longer constitutes a public health emergency, or\nThe CDC Director rescinds or modifies the order based on specific public health or other considerations, or\n100 days have passed from April 15, the date the extended order was published in the Federal Register and went into effect. 100 days from April 15 is July 24.\n\nWhy did CDC extend the No Sail Order?\nThe No Sail Order was extended to protect the public, cruise ship passengers,\ncruise ship crews, and other industry workers. By restricting cruise ship\npassenger operations, the Order helps achieve several public health goals:\n\nPrevents further spread of COVID-19 into and within the United States\nPreserves critical federal, state, and local resources that are needed to respond to COVID-19\nPreserves critical healthcare, emergency, and port resources\n\nWhat cruise ships does the No Sail Order cover?\nThe No Sail Order applies to all cruise ships, which it defines as commercial\npassenger ships with the capacity to carry more than 250 people and where an\novernight stay onboard by passengers or crew is anticipated. The Order applies\nto all cruise ships operating, or seeking to operate, in waters subject to US\njurisdiction, including those that have previously voluntarily suspended\noperations. It does not apply to cargo ships.\nWhat does the No Sail Order mean for my upcoming trip?\nPassengers who plan to travel by cruise ship should contact their cruise line\ncompanies directly for further information.\nOn March 17, 2020, CDC issued a Level 3 travel health\nnotice\nwith a clear recommendation to avoid all cruise travel due to ongoing spread\nof COVID-19 and the increased risk of person-to-person spread of infectious\ndiseases on cruise ships. The No Sail Order suspends all cruise ship\noperations in waters subject to US jurisdiction.\nWhat is CDC doing to help cruise ships with crew still on board?\nWe are currently in a phase of the pandemic where it is necessary to implement\nstrict measures to control the spread of COVID-19. Just as the American public\nhas a role to play in practicing social distancing, cruise lines have a role\nto play in properly caring for their crew, including making sure they can\npractice social distancing, isolating them if they are sick, and quarantining\nthem if they have been exposed to COVID-19.\nCDC is committed to the safety and well-being of crew members while onboard\nand as they disembark. CDC is allowing crew members to disembark from cruise\nships in U.S. waters and return home if cruise lines submit a signed\nattestation stating that they\nhave complied with requirements to safely disembark their crew members. Crew\nmembers who remain onboard and want to disembark should contact their cruise\nship or cruise line about meeting CDC requirements for safe disembarkation and\ntransport. A list of disembarkations that CDC has approved is available\nhere.\nCrew members on ships in or intending to be in US waters who have questions\nabout the process for disembarkation or who have concerns about what their\nship is doing to prevent COVID-19 onboard can share their questions or\nconcerns with CDC by sending an email to\neocevent431@cdc.gov.\nCruise ships have medical facilities on board that can provide medical care to\nsick crew members as needed. As part of their cruise ship plans, cruise lines\nshould make sure they have enough medical staff, equipment, supplies, and\nother resources to provide care for sick people on board. They also need a\nplan to transfer sick crew members to a hospital on land if they need medical\ncare that the ship’s medical facility can’t provide.\nCDC and federal partners are monitoring ships with crew only, and we are\nworking with the cruise companies and local and state health departments to\nensure that seriously ill crew members can get medical assistance on land if\nthe ship can’t provide it. CDC remains committed to humanitarian medical\nevacuation for people in need of lifesaving support. Emergency medical\nevacuations do not require CDC approval.\nWhat is CDC doing to help cruise ships with passengers still on board?\nA small number of passengers are still aboard cruise ships in and around US\nwaters. These passengers are awaiting repatriation to their home countries.\nCDC is working with partners as part of the Unified Command, including Coast\nGuard, Customs and Border Protection, port authorities, local and state health\ndepartments, and Department of State, along with cruise lines, to help\nremaining cruise ship passengers get home as quickly and safely as possible.\nThese are cruise ships that had international voyages with U.S. ports, and\ntherefore are under CDC jurisdiction. International voyages without U.S. ports\nof call are not under CDC jurisdiction and not included.\nInternational cruise voyages with U.S. domestic ports of call have been\nsuspended since March 14, 2020, under CDC’s No Sail\nOrder.

A list of disembarkations that CDC has approved is available\n<a href=\"/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/cruise-ship/cruise-ship-member-\ndisembarkations.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Crew members on ships in or intending to be in US waters who have questions\nabout the process for disembarkation or who have concerns about what their\nship is doing to prevent COVID-19 onboard can share their questions or\nconcerns with CDC by sending an email to\n<a href=\"mailto:eocevent431@cdc.gov\">eocevent431@cdc.gov</a>.</p>\n<p>Cruise ships have medical facilities on board that can provide medical care to\nsick crew members as needed. As part of their cruise ship plans, cruise lines\nshould make sure they have enough medical staff, equipment, supplies, and\nother resources to provide care for sick people on board. They also need a\nplan to transfer sick crew members to a hospital on land if they need medical\ncare that the ship’s medical facility can’t provide.</p>\n<p>CDC and federal partners are monitoring ships with crew only, and we are\nworking with the cruise companies and local and state health departments to\nensure that seriously ill crew members can get medical assistance on land if\nthe ship can’t provide it. CDC remains committed to humanitarian medical\nevacuation for people in need of lifesaving support. Emergency medical\nevacuations do not require CDC approval.</p>\n<p><strong>What is CDC doing to help cruise ships with passengers still on board?</strong></p>\n<p>A small number of passengers are still aboard cruise ships in and around US\nwaters. These passengers are awaiting repatriation to their home countries.\nCDC is working with partners as part of the Unified Command, including Coast\nGuard, Customs and Border Protection, port authorities, local and state health\ndepartments, and Department of State, along with cruise lines, to help\nremaining cruise ship passengers get home as quickly and safely as possible.</p>\n<p>These are cruise ships that had international voyages with U.S. ports, and\ntherefore are under CDC jurisdiction. International voyages without U.S. ports\nof call are not under CDC jurisdiction and not included.</p>\n<p>International cruise voyages with U.S. domestic ports of call have been\nsuspended since March 14, 2020, under CDC’s <a href=\"/quarantine/cruise/index.html\">No Sail\nOrder</a>. <strong>Therefore, this chart is available\nfor historical purposes but is no longer being updated.</strong></p>\n<p>Cruise Ships Affected by COVID-19 Ship name | Voyage Start Date | Voyage End\nDate<br />\n---|---|---<br />\nCarnival Freedom | 8-Mar | 15-Mar<br />\nCarnival Imagination | 5-Mar | 8-Mar<br />\nCarnival Valor | 29-Feb | 5-Mar<br />\nCarnival Valor | 5-Mar | 9-Mar<br />\nCarnival Valor | 9-Mar | 14-Mar<br />\nCarnival Vista | 15-Feb | 22-Feb<br />\nCarnival Vista | 29-Feb | 7-Mar<br />\nCelebrity Eclipse<em> | 2-Mar | 30-Mar<br />\nCelebrity Infinity | 5-Mar | 9-Mar<br />\nCelebrity Reflection | 13-Mar | 17-Mar<br />\nCelebrity Summit | 29-Feb | 7-Mar<br />\nCoral Princess</em> | 5-Mar | 4-Apr<br />\nCrown Princess | 6-Mar | 16-Mar<br />\nDisney Wonder | 28-Feb | 2-Mar<br />\nDisney Wonder<em> | 6-Mar | 20-Mar<br />\nGrand Princess | 11-Feb | 21-Feb<br />\nGrand Princess</em> | 21-Feb | 7-Mar<br />\nHolland America Zaandam<em> | 7-Mar | 2-Apr<br />\nMSC Armonia</em> | 2-Mar | 9-Mar<br />\nMSC Meraviglia | 1-Mar | 8-Mar<br />\nNorwegian Bliss<em> | 1-Mar | 8-Mar<br />\nNorwegian Bliss | 8-Mar | 15-Mar<br />\nNorwegian Breakaway | 29-Feb | 7-Mar<br />\nNorwegian Breakaway</em> | 7-Mar | 14-Mar<br />\nNorwegian Encore | 8-Mar | 15-Mar<br />\nOceania Riviera<em> | 26-Feb | 11-Mar<br />\nRCCL Explorer of Seas | 8-Mar | 15-Mar<br />\nRCCL Liberty of the Seas</em> | 15-Mar | 29-Mar<br />\nRCCL Majesty of the Seas<em> | 29-Feb | 7-Mar<br />\nRCCL Rhapsody of the Seas | 7-Mar | 14-Mar<br />\nRCCL Oasis of the Seas</em> | 8-Mar | 15-Mar<br />\nRCCL Symphony of the Seas* | 7-Mar | 14-Mar  </p>\n<p><em>*CDC was notified about COVID-19-positive travelers who had symptoms while on\nboard these ships.<br />\nFor all other ships, CDC was notified about travelers who had symptoms and\ntested positive for COVID-19 within 14 days after disembarking.

Often, information in nursing homes is\ncommunicated through town hall meetings and staff meetings, along with letters\nor emails. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person gatherings should\nnot occur. Instead, communication should occur through virtual meetings over\nphone or web platforms. These should be supplemented with written\ncommunications that provide contact information for a staff member who can\nrespond to questions or concerns. Communications should include information\ndescribing the current situation, plans for limiting spread within the\nfacility, and recommended actions they can take to protect themselves and\nothers. Facilities should make this information available in a timely manner\nand offer periodic updates as the situation develops and more information\nbecomes available.</p>"

Two tests allow you to\ncollect your own sample at home – either a <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-\ncovid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-test-patient-home-sample-collection\">nasal swabexternal\nicon</a> or a\n<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-\nannouncements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-diagnostic-\ntest-using-home-collection-saliva\">saliva sampleexternal icon</a> – but you will still need to send the\nsample to a lab for processing.</p>\n<p>Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see\nquestion: Where can I get tested). Check with your testing site to learn which\ntest it uses. You can find a<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-\nsituations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations#covid19ivd\"> patient information sheet about each test on the\nFDA websiteexternal icon</a>.</p>"

There are\nseveral methods that employers can use to protect the employee conducting the\ntemperature screening. The most protective methods incorporate social\ndistancing (maintaining a distance of 6 feet from others), or physical\nbarriers to eliminate or minimize the screener’s exposures due to close\ncontact with a person who has symptoms during screening. Examples to consider\nthat incorporate these types of controls for temperature screening include:\n\nReliance on Social Distancing : Ask employees to take their own temperature either before coming to the workplace or upon arrival at the workplace. Upon their arrival, stand at least 6 feet away from the employee and: \nAsk the employee to confirm that their temperature is less than 100.4o F (38.0o C), and confirm that they are not experiencing coughing or shortness of breath.\nMake a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue.\nScreening staff do not need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) if they can maintain a distance of 6 feet.\n\n\nReliance on Barrier/Partition Controls : During screening, the screener stands behind a physical barrier, such as a glass or plastic window or partition, that can protect the screener’s face and mucous membranes from respiratory droplets that may be produced when the employee sneezes, coughs, or talks. Upon arrival, the screener should wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, if soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Then: \nMake a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue.\nConduct temperature and symptom screening using this protocol: \nPut on disposable gloves.\nCheck the employee’s temperature, reaching around the partition or through the window. Make sure the screener’s face stays behind the barrier at all times during the screening.\nIf performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, make sure that you use a clean pair of gloves for each employee and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check. If disposable or non-contact thermometers are used and you did not have physical contact with an individual, you do not need to change gloves before the next check. If non-contact thermometers are used, clean and disinfect them according to manufacturer’s instructions and facility policies.\nRemove and discard PPE (gloves), and wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\n\n\n\nIf social distance or barrier controls cannot be implemented during screening,\nPPE can be used when the screener is within 6 feet of an employee during\nscreening. However, reliance on PPE alone is a less effective control and more\ndifficult to implement given PPE shortages and training requirements.\n\nReliance on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) : Upon arrival, the screener should wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, put on a facemask, eye protection (goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face), and a single pair of disposable gloves. A gown could be considered if extensive contact with an employee is anticipated. Then: \nMake a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue, and confirm that the employee is not experiencing coughing or shortness of breath.\nTake the employee’s temperature. \nIf performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, make sure that you use a clean pair of gloves for each employee and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check. If disposable or non-contact thermometers are used and you did not have physical contact with an individual, you do not need to change gloves before the next check.

Management should also consider increasing\nventilation rates and/or the percentage of outdoor air that circulates within\nthe shared living and working areas.</p>\n<p>When feasible, management should employ mechanisms to support their employees\nand limit employees’ interactions with others during this period. This may\ninclude online ordered and delivered groceries, delivered meals, and virtual\nand online training tasks.</p>\n<p>After the initial 14-day period is over, fire crews and modules who work\ntogether and do not have regular interactions with other people can isolate as\na unit. During this time, personnel should continue to cover their mouth and\nnose with tissue or elbow when they cough or sneeze, perform proper <a href=\"/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html\">hand\nhygiene</a> and frequently <a href=\"/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-\nfacility.html\">clean and\ndisinfect</a> shared spaces,\n<a href=\"/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/disinfecting-\ntransport-vehicles.html\">vehicles</a>, and equipment with <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-\ndisinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2\">EPA-registered\ndisinfectantsexternal icon</a> that are appropriate for the surface and\neffective against SARS-CoV-2, following label instructions. If a crew operates\nas a unit, it is not necessary for crew members to wear face coverings unless\nthey are <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#Preparing-Your-Home-\nand-Family-for-COVID-19\">not feeling\nwell</a> or interacting with the public (consistent with CDC\nguidelines for <a href=\"/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/living-in-close-\nquarters.html\">households living in close\nquarters</a>). If interactions with the general public must occur, all\npersonnel should practice social distancing, wear cloth face coverings,\nperform hand hygiene, and disinfect surfaces, objects, or items that are\nshared with the general public.</p>\n<p>For more information, see CDC’s COVID-19 <a href=\"/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/shared-congregate-house/guidance-\nshared-congregate-housing.html#common-spaces\">Guidance for Shared or Congregate\nHousing</a>.</p>"

Contactless deliveries allow you to leave a delivery at a doorstep, move back to a distance greater than 6 feet away while verifying receipt of the delivery with the recipient (if required), and try to do everything electronically whenever you can (e.g., in an app or over a phone). This eliminates the need for close contact between you and delivery recipient.\nMaintain a distance 6 feet or greater from others you might meet or need to speak to while making your deliveries.\nLimit contact with frequently touched surfaces during deliveries, such as doorbells or door handles. Use a foot, shoulder, elbow, hip, or forearm when opening doors, instead of hands, if possible.\nAvoid sharing scanners, pens, or other tools with customers.\nIf you are wearing machine-washable work gloves normally worn for the job throughout your shift, do not touch your face with gloved hands. Remove them and wash hands before eating. At the end of the work shift, remove the gloves, store them for washing, and wash your hands. When doing laundry, wash gloves using the warmest appropriate water setting and dry them completely.\n\nClean and Disinfect\n\nIf surfaces are visibly dirty, they should be cleaned with detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.\nCarry cleaning and disinfectant disposable wipes, if available, and a trash bag with you in your vehicle. Follow the directions on the cleaning product’s label. \nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces of the delivery vehicle (particularly if it is shared) at the start and end of the shift. These include the steering wheel, gearshift, signaling levers, and door handles.\nWipe down pens, clipboards, and electronic signature pads after each use with the public if shared when performing a delivery.\n\n\nAppropriate disinfectants for hard non-porous surfaces include: \nEPA’s Registered Antimicrobial Products for Use Against Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2external icon\nDiluted household bleach solutions prepared according to the manufacturers label for disinfection, if appropriate for the surface\nAlcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol.\n\n\n\nPractice Everyday Preventive Actions\n\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.\nProper hand hygiene is an important infection control measure. Keep in mind where you can access and use facilities with soap and water during your shift. Wash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.\nKey times to clean hands include: \nBefore, during, and after preparing food\nBefore eating food\nAfter using the toilet\nAfter blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing\n\n\n\nAdditional times on the job to clean hands include: \n\nBefore and after work shifts\nBefore and after work breaks\nAfter putting on, touching, or removing cloth face coverings\nBefore and after making deliveries, including after picking up from drop-boxes and customer pickups\nAfter touching frequently touched surfaces, such as doorbells or door handles\nBefore wearing and after removing cold-weather gloves\nBefore and after pumping gas\n\n\n\nCarry tissues in your vehicle to use when you cough, sneeze, or touch your face.

                        "section_content": "Outbreaks of infectious diseases can happen on cruise ships because people\nspend time close together and with travelers from many countries. Disease can\nspread between ships when crew members from a ship with an outbreak transfer\nto other ships. Infected people may also travel on cruise ships between\ncountries. For these reasons, outbreaks of COVID-19 on cruise ships pose a\nrisk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage and into communities across\nthe globe.\nBecause of the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the high risk\nof COVID-19 spread on cruise ships, the US government issued a No Sail Order\nfor cruise ships in waters subject to US jurisdiction and has advised US\ntravelers to defer all cruise\ntravel.\nThe No Sail Order is published in the Federal\nRegister.\nCDC continues to work to control COVID-19 on cruise ships at sea while also\nprotecting against further introduction and spread of COVID-19 into\ncommunities. The COVID-19 pandemic is constantly evolving, and aggressive\nefforts are needed to contain the spread. CDC will continue to evaluate and\nupdate our recommendations as the situation evolves.\nWhat is the No Sail Order?\nIn response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and the increased risk of\nspread of COVID-19 on cruise ships, CDC published the first industry-wide No\nSail Order on March 14 to\nprevent, among other things, new passengers from boarding cruise ships. CDC\nextended its No Sail Order, effective April 15, 2020, to continue to suspend\nall cruise ship operations in waters subject to US jurisdiction. Among other\nthings, cruise lines are required to develop comprehensive plans to prevent,\ndetect, respond to, and contain COVID-19 on their cruise ships to protect the\nhealth and safety of both passengers and crew.\nHow long is the No Sail Order in effect?\nThe extended Order is in effect until one of the following occurs:\n\nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services declares that COVID-19 no longer constitutes a public health emergency, or\nThe CDC Director rescinds or modifies the order based on specific public health or other considerations, or\n100 days have passed from April 15, the date the extended order was published in the Federal Register and went into effect. 100 days from April 15 is July 24.\n\nWhy did CDC extend the No Sail Order?\nThe No Sail Order was extended to protect the public, cruise ship passengers,\ncruise ship crews, and other industry workers. By restricting cruise ship\npassenger operations, the Order helps achieve several public health goals:\n\nPrevents further spread of COVID-19 into and within the United States\nPreserves critical federal, state, and local resources that are needed to respond to COVID-19\nPreserves critical healthcare, emergency, and port resources\n\nWhat cruise ships does the No Sail Order cover?\nThe No Sail Order applies to all cruise ships, which it defines as commercial\npassenger ships with the capacity to carry more than 250 people and where an\novernight stay onboard by passengers or crew is anticipated. The Order applies\nto all cruise ships operating, or seeking to operate, in waters subject to US\njurisdiction, including those that have previously voluntarily suspended\noperations. It does not apply to cargo ships.\nWhat does the No Sail Order mean for my upcoming trip?\nPassengers who plan to travel by cruise ship should contact their cruise line\ncompanies directly for further information.\nOn March 17, 2020, CDC issued a Level 3 travel health\nnotice\nwith a clear recommendation to avoid all cruise travel due to ongoing spread\nof COVID-19 and the increased risk of person-to-person spread of infectious\ndiseases on cruise ships. The No Sail Order suspends all cruise ship\noperations in waters subject to US jurisdiction.\nWhat is CDC doing to help cruise ships with crew still on board?\nWe are currently in a phase of the pandemic where it is necessary to implement\nstrict measures to control the spread of COVID-19. Just as the American public\nhas a role to play in practicing social distancing, cruise lines have a role\nto play in properly caring for their crew, including making sure they can\npractice social distancing, isolating them if they are sick, and quarantining\nthem if they have been exposed to COVID-19.\nCDC is committed to the safety and well-being of crew members while onboard\nand as they disembark. CDC is allowing crew members to disembark from cruise\nships in U.S. waters and return home if cruise lines submit a signed\nattestation stating that they\nhave complied with requirements to safely disembark their crew members. Crew\nmembers who remain onboard and want to disembark should contact their cruise\nship or cruise line about meeting CDC requirements for safe disembarkation and\ntransport. A list of disembarkations that CDC has approved is available\nhere.\nCrew members on ships in or intending to be in US waters who have questions\nabout the process for disembarkation or who have concerns about what their\nship is doing to prevent COVID-19 onboard can share their questions or\nconcerns with CDC by sending an email to\neocevent431@cdc.gov.\nCruise ships have medical facilities on board that can provide medical care to\nsick crew members as needed. As part of their cruise ship plans, cruise lines\nshould make sure they have enough medical staff, equipment, supplies, and\nother resources to provide care for sick people on board. They also need a\nplan to transfer sick crew members to a hospital on land if they need medical\ncare that the ship’s medical facility can’t provide.\nCDC and federal partners are monitoring ships with crew only, and we are\nworking with the cruise companies and local and state health departments to\nensure that seriously ill crew members can get medical assistance on land if\nthe ship can’t provide it. CDC remains committed to humanitarian medical\nevacuation for people in need of lifesaving support. Emergency medical\nevacuations do not require CDC approval.\nWhat is CDC doing to help cruise ships with passengers still on board?\nA small number of passengers are still aboard cruise ships in and around US\nwaters. These passengers are awaiting repatriation to their home countries.\nCDC is working with partners as part of the Unified Command, including Coast\nGuard, Customs and Border Protection, port authorities, local and state health\ndepartments, and Department of State, along with cruise lines, to help\nremaining cruise ship passengers get home as quickly and safely as possible.\nThese are cruise ships that had international voyages with U.S. ports, and\ntherefore are under CDC jurisdiction. International voyages without U.S. ports\nof call are not under CDC jurisdiction and not included.\nInternational cruise voyages with U.S. domestic ports of call have been\nsuspended since March 14, 2020, under CDC’s No Sail\nOrder. Therefore, this chart is available\nfor historical purposes but is no longer being updated.\nCruise Ships Affected by COVID-19 Ship name | Voyage Start Date | Voyage End\nDate\n---|---|---\nCarnival Freedom | 8-Mar | 15-Mar\nCarnival Imagination | 5-Mar | 8-Mar\nCarnival Valor | 29-Feb | 5-Mar\nCarnival Valor | 5-Mar | 9-Mar\nCarnival Valor | 9-Mar | 14-Mar\nCarnival Vista | 15-Feb | 22-Feb\nCarnival Vista | 29-Feb | 7-Mar\nCelebrity Eclipse | 2-Mar | 30-Mar\nCelebrity Infinity | 5-Mar | 9-Mar\nCelebrity Reflection | 13-Mar | 17-Mar\nCelebrity Summit | 29-Feb | 7-Mar\nCoral Princess | 5-Mar | 4-Apr\nCrown Princess | 6-Mar | 16-Mar\nDisney Wonder | 28-Feb | 2-Mar\nDisney Wonder | 6-Mar | 20-Mar\nGrand Princess | 11-Feb | 21-Feb\nGrand Princess | 21-Feb | 7-Mar\nHolland America Zaandam | 7-Mar | 2-Apr\nMSC Armonia | 2-Mar | 9-Mar\nMSC Meraviglia | 1-Mar | 8-Mar\nNorwegian Bliss | 1-Mar | 8-Mar\nNorwegian Bliss | 8-Mar | 15-Mar\nNorwegian Breakaway | 29-Feb | 7-Mar\nNorwegian Breakaway | 7-Mar | 14-Mar\nNorwegian Encore | 8-Mar | 15-Mar\nOceania Riviera | 26-Feb | 11-Mar\nRCCL Explorer of Seas | 8-Mar | 15-Mar\nRCCL Liberty of the Seas | 15-Mar | 29-Mar\nRCCL Majesty of the Seas | 29-Feb | 7-Mar\nRCCL Rhapsody of the Seas | 7-Mar | 14-Mar\nRCCL Oasis of the Seas | 8-Mar | 15-Mar\nRCCL Symphony of the Seas* | 7-Mar | 14-Mar  \n*CDC was notified about COVID-19-positive travelers who had symptoms while on\nboard these ships.\nFor all other ships, CDC was notified about travelers who had symptoms and\ntested positive for COVID-19 within 14 days after disembarking.

For these reasons, outbreaks of COVID-19 on cruise ships pose a\nrisk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage and into communities across\nthe globe.</p>\n<p>Because of the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the high risk\nof COVID-19 spread on cruise ships, the US government issued a No Sail Order\nfor cruise ships in waters subject to US jurisdiction and has advised US\ntravelers to <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-cruise-ship\">defer all cruise\ntravel</a>.\nThe No Sail Order is published in the <a href=\"/quarantine/cruise/index.html\">Federal\nRegister</a>.</p>\n<p>CDC continues to work to control COVID-19 on cruise ships at sea while also\nprotecting against further introduction and spread of COVID-19 into\ncommunities. The COVID-19 pandemic is constantly evolving, and aggressive\nefforts are needed to contain the spread. CDC will continue to evaluate and\nupdate our recommendations as the situation evolves.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the No Sail Order?</strong></p>\n<p>In response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and the increased risk of\nspread of COVID-19 on cruise ships, CDC published the first industry-wide <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/cruise/index.html\">No\nSail Order</a> on March 14 to\nprevent, among other things, new passengers from boarding cruise ships. CDC\nextended its No Sail Order, effective April 15, 2020, to continue to suspend\nall cruise ship operations in waters subject to US jurisdiction. Among other\nthings, cruise lines are required to develop comprehensive plans to prevent,\ndetect, respond to, and contain COVID-19 on their cruise ships to protect the\nhealth and safety of both passengers and crew.</p>\n<p><strong>How long is the No Sail Order in effect?</strong></p>\n<p>The extended Order is in effect until one of the following occurs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Secretary of Health and Human Services declares that COVID-19 no longer constitutes a public health emergency, or</li>\n<li>The CDC Director rescinds or modifies the order based on specific public health or other considerations, or</li>\n<li>100 days have passed from April 15, the date the extended order was published in the <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/04/15/2020-07930/no-sail-order-and-suspension-of-further-embarkation-notice-of-modification-and-extension-and-other\">Federal Register</a> and went into effect. 100 days from April 15 is July 24.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why did CDC extend the No Sail Order?</strong></p>\n<p>The No Sail Order was extended to protect the public, cruise ship passengers,\ncruise ship crews, and other industry workers. By restricting cruise ship\npassenger operations, the Order helps achieve several public health goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevents further spread of COVID-19 into and within the United States</li>\n<li>Preserves critical federal, state, and local resources that are needed to respond to COVID-19</li>\n<li>Preserves critical healthcare, emergency, and port resources</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What cruise ships does the No Sail Order cover?</strong></p>\n<p>The No Sail Order applies to all cruise ships, which it defines as commercial\npassenger ships with the capacity to carry more than 250 people and where an\novernight stay onboard by passengers or crew is anticipated. The Order applies\nto all cruise ships operating, or seeking to operate, in waters subject to US\njurisdiction, including those that have previously voluntarily suspended\noperations. It does not apply to cargo ships.</p>\n<p><strong>What does the No Sail Order mean for my upcoming trip?</strong></p>\n<p>Passengers who plan to travel by cruise ship should contact their cruise line\ncompanies directly for further information.</p>\n<p>On March 17, 2020, CDC issued a <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-cruise-ship\">Level 3 travel health\nnotice</a>\nwith a clear recommendation to avoid all cruise travel due to ongoing spread\nof COVID-19 and the increased risk of person-to-person spread of infectious\ndiseases on cruise ships. The No Sail Order suspends all cruise ship\noperations in waters subject to US jurisdiction.</p>\n<p><strong>What is CDC doing to help cruise ships with crew still on board?</strong></p>\n<p>We are currently in a phase of the pandemic where it is necessary to implement\nstrict measures to control the spread of COVID-19. Just as the American public\nhas a role to play in practicing social distancing, cruise lines have a role\nto play in properly caring for their crew, including making sure they can\npractice social distancing, isolating them if they are sick, and quarantining\nthem if they have been exposed to COVID-19.</p>\n<p>CDC is committed to the safety and well-being of crew members while onboard\nand as they disembark. CDC is allowing crew members to disembark from cruise\nships in U.S. waters and return home if cruise lines submit a <a href=\"/quarantine/pdf/Attestation-for-Non-Commercial-Travel-Pre-\nApproval-of-NSO-Response-Plan_042320_final_fillable-p.pdf\">signed\nattestation</a> stating that they\nhave complied with requirements to safely disembark their crew members. Crew\nmembers who remain onboard and want to disembark should contact their cruise\nship or cruise line about meeting CDC requirements for safe disembarkation and\ntransport. A list of disembarkations that CDC has approved is available\n<a href=\"/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/cruise-ship/cruise-ship-member-\ndisembarkations.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Crew members on ships in or intending to be in US waters who have questions\nabout the process for disembarkation or who have concerns about what their\nship is doing to prevent COVID-19 onboard can share their questions or\nconcerns with CDC by sending an email to\n<a href=\"mailto:eocevent431@cdc.gov\">eocevent431@cdc.gov</a>.</p>\n<p>Cruise ships have medical facilities on board that can provide medical care to\nsick crew members as needed. As part of their cruise ship plans, cruise lines\nshould make sure they have enough medical staff, equipment, supplies, and\nother resources to provide care for sick people on board. They also need a\nplan to transfer sick crew members to a hospital on land if they need medical\ncare that the ship’s medical facility can’t provide.</p>\n<p>CDC and federal partners are monitoring ships with crew only, and we are\nworking with the cruise companies and local and state health departments to\nensure that seriously ill crew members can get medical assistance on land if\nthe ship can’t provide it. CDC remains committed to humanitarian medical\nevacuation for people in need of lifesaving support. Emergency medical\nevacuations do not require CDC approval.</p>\n<p><strong>What is CDC doing to help cruise ships with passengers still on board?</strong></p>\n<p>A small number of passengers are still aboard cruise ships in and around US\nwaters. These passengers are awaiting repatriation to their home countries.\nCDC is working with partners as part of the Unified Command, including Coast\nGuard, Customs and Border Protection, port authorities, local and state health\ndepartments, and Department of State, along with cruise lines, to help\nremaining cruise ship passengers get home as quickly and safely as possible.</p>\n<p>These are cruise ships that had international voyages with U.S. ports, and\ntherefore are under CDC jurisdiction. International voyages without U.S. ports\nof call are not under CDC jurisdiction and not included.</p>\n<p>International cruise voyages with U.S. domestic ports of call have been\nsuspended since March 14, 2020, under CDC’s <a href=\"/quarantine/cruise/index.html\">No Sail\nOrder</a>. <strong>Therefore, this chart is available\nfor historical purposes but is no longer being updated.</strong></p>\n<p>Cruise Ships Affected by COVID-19 Ship name | Voyage Start Date | Voyage End\nDate<br />\n---|---|---<br />\nCarnival Freedom | 8-Mar | 15-Mar<br />\nCarnival Imagination | 5-Mar | 8-Mar<br />\nCarnival Valor | 29-Feb | 5-Mar<br />\nCarnival Valor | 5-Mar | 9-Mar<br />\nCarnival Valor | 9-Mar | 14-Mar<br />\nCarnival Vista | 15-Feb | 22-Feb<br />\nCarnival Vista | 29-Feb | 7-Mar<br />\nCelebrity Eclipse<em> | 2-Mar | 30-Mar<br />\nCelebrity Infinity | 5-Mar | 9-Mar<br />\nCelebrity Reflection | 13-Mar | 17-Mar<br />\nCelebrity Summit | 29-Feb | 7-Mar<br />\nCoral Princess</em> | 5-Mar | 4-Apr<br />\nCrown Princess | 6-Mar | 16-Mar<br />\nDisney Wonder | 28-Feb | 2-Mar<br />\nDisney Wonder<em> | 6-Mar | 20-Mar<br />\nGrand Princess | 11-Feb | 21-Feb<br />\nGrand Princess</em> | 21-Feb | 7-Mar<br />\nHolland America Zaandam<em> | 7-Mar | 2-Apr<br />\nMSC Armonia</em> | 2-Mar | 9-Mar<br />\nMSC Meraviglia | 1-Mar | 8-Mar<br />\nNorwegian Bliss<em> | 1-Mar | 8-Mar<br />\nNorwegian Bliss | 8-Mar | 15-Mar<br />\nNorwegian Breakaway | 29-Feb | 7-Mar<br />\nNorwegian Breakaway</em> | 7-Mar | 14-Mar<br />\nNorwegian Encore | 8-Mar | 15-Mar<br />\nOceania Riviera<em> | 26-Feb | 11-Mar<br />\nRCCL Explorer of Seas | 8-Mar | 15-Mar<br />\nRCCL Liberty of the Seas</em> | 15-Mar | 29-Mar<br />\nRCCL Majesty of the Seas<em> | 29-Feb | 7-Mar<br />\nRCCL Rhapsody of the Seas | 7-Mar | 14-Mar<br />\nRCCL Oasis of the Seas</em> | 8-Mar | 15-Mar<br />\nRCCL Symphony of the Seas* | 7-Mar | 14-Mar  </p>\n<p><em>*CDC was notified about COVID-19-positive travelers who had symptoms while on\nboard these ships.<br />\nFor all other ships, CDC was notified about travelers who had symptoms and\ntested positive for COVID-19 within 14 days after disembarking.
