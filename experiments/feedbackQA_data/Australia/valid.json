It is important we do not move too quickly and risk losing the control we have achieved. Some businesses will start to reopen as we start to allow groups of up to 10 people to be together in homes and in the community. These steps help build our COVIDSafe economy, and also give us more opportunities to connect with family and friends.\nThe second steps in each area will build on this through larger gatherings and even more businesses reopening. As businesses take steps to ensure they are COVIDSafe, we should all feel safe and confident doing some of the things we’ve missed over the last few months. Some higher-risk settings and activities will still be tightly restricted.\nThe third steps are where we start to fully embrace long-term COVIDSafe ways of living and working — the arrangements that will be our ‘new normal’ while the virus remains a threat.

Therefore, their reference period is 30 September 2019 to 13 October 2019.\n\nFor example\n\nAn OSHC service provides both vacation care and before and after school care. Their reference period is from 17 February 2020 to 1 March 2020.\n\nFor example\n\nAn OSHC service operating in New South Wales providing only vacation care, charged fees for one week in the school holiday period between Terms 3 and 4 in 2019. However, the reference fortnight for the service does not change, meaning that the base weekly amount for the provider of the service that is calculated under the Rules, would be effectively half of the amount it would be if the service had operated for the full reference fortnight, instead of only one week. However, the provider of the service will receive an Exceptional Circumstance Supplementary Payment to adjust for the week.\n\nThe payment amount will be determined based on the total fees charged by the\nservice during a reference fortnight and the reference hourly fee (up to\nhourly rate cap) for a session of care.\nFor example\nOn the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, a Centre Based Day Care service\n(CBDC) had 20 children attending the service. Each child attended 10 sessions\nof care for the fortnight (or five per week) and were charged $100 for a 10\nhour session (meaning the hourly fee was $10). This example assumes that all\nof the children were charged the same amount for the same session lengths. For\nthat fortnight, the service’s total fees charged were $20,000 (or $10,000 per\nweek).\nThe payment this service will receive is worked out below:\n\nthe service’s hourly reference fee is $10 (because it is lower than the CBDC hourly rate cap)\n$10 hourly fee x 50 per cent = $5 paid per hour\n$5 x 10 hour session = $50 paid per session\n$50 x 20 children x 5 sessions per week = $5,000 paid per week.\n\nFor example:\nOn the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, a CBDC service had 20 children\nattending the service. Each child attended 10 sessions of care per fortnight\n(or five per week) and was charged $130 for a 10 hour session (meaning the\nhourly fee was $13). This example assumes that all of the children were\ncharged the same amount for the same session lengths.
