However, the reference fortnight for the service does not change, meaning that the base weekly amount for the provider of the service that is calculated under the Rules, would be effectively half of the amount it would be if the service had operated for the full reference fortnight, instead of only one week. However, the provider of the service will receive an Exceptional Circumstance Supplementary Payment to adjust for the week.\n\nThe payment amount will be determined based on the total fees charged by the\nservice during a reference fortnight and the reference hourly fee (up to\nhourly rate cap) for a session of care.\nFor example\nOn the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, a Centre Based Day Care service\n(CBDC) had 20 children attending the service. Each child attended 10 sessions\nof care for the fortnight (or five per week) and were charged $100 for a 10\nhour session (meaning the hourly fee was $10). This example assumes that all\nof the children were charged the same amount for the same session lengths. For\nthat fortnight, the service’s total fees charged were $20,000 (or $10,000 per\nweek).\nThe payment this service will receive is worked out below:\n\nthe service’s hourly reference fee is $10 (because it is lower than the CBDC hourly rate cap)\n$10 hourly fee x 50 per cent = $5 paid per hour\n$5 x 10 hour session = $50 paid per session\n$50 x 20 children x 5 sessions per week = $5,000 paid per week.\n\nFor example:\nOn the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, a CBDC service had 20 children\nattending the service. Each child attended 10 sessions of care per fortnight\n(or five per week) and was charged $130 for a 10 hour session (meaning the\nhourly fee was $13). This example assumes that all of the children were\ncharged the same amount for the same session lengths. For that fortnight, the\nservice’s total fees charged were $26,000 (or $13,000 per week).\nThe payment is worked out below:\n\nthe service’s hourly reference fee is $11.98 (because their hourly fee is above the CBDC hourly rate cap at $13)\n$11.98 x 50 per cent = $5.99 paid in business continuity per hour\n$5.99 x 10 hour session = $59.90 paid in business continuity per session\n$59.90 x 20 children x 5 sessions per week = $5,990 paid to the service per week.\n\nThe reference fortnight is as follows:\n\nFor an OSHC service that provides only vacation care–the fortnight starting on the first Monday of the school holidays between school Term 3 and Term 4 in 2019 in the state or territory in which the service is located.\nFor all other services–the fortnight starting 17 February 2020.\nNote: where a service charged fees for only one week of care during the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, or in the school holidays between Terms 3 and 4 in 2019, an Exceptional Circumstance Supplementary Payment will made in accordance with these rules.\n\nFor example:\n\nAn OSHC service that operates in New South Wales provides only vacation care. Therefore, their reference period is 30 September 2019 to 13 October 2019.\n\nFor example:\n\nAn OSHC service provides both vacation care and before and after school care. Their reference period is from 17 February 2020 to 1 March 2020.\n\nFor example:\n\nAn OSHC service operating in New South Wales providing only vacation care, charged fees for one week in the school holiday period between Terms 3 and 4 in 2019. However, the reference fortnight for the service does not change, meaning that the base weekly amount for the provider of the service that is calculated under the Rules would be effectively half of the amount it would be if the service had operated for the full reference fortnight, instead of only one week. However, the provider of the service will receive an Exceptional Circumstance Supplementary Payment to adjust for the week.\n\nThe reference hourly fee for a session is 50 per cent of the lower of:\n\nthe hourly fee for the session; or\nthe relevant Child Care Subsidy hourly rate cap.\n\nFor example:\n\na CBDC service charges $100 for a 10 hour session of care. Therefore, their hourly fee is $10 per hour ($100 ÷ 10 = $10)\nThe CBDC hourly rate cap is $11.98\nThe reference hourly fee is the hourly fee ($10) because it is lower\n50 per cent of the hourly session fee is $5 ($10 x 50 per cent = $5).\n\nFor example:\n\na CBDC service charges $130 for a 10 hour session of care. Therefore, their hourly fee is $13 per hour ($130 ÷ 10 = $13)\nThe CBDC hourly rate cap is $11.98\nThe reference hourly fee is the CBDC hourly rate cap ($11.98) because it is lower\n50 per cent of the hourly reference fee is $5.99 ($11.98 x 50 per cent = $5.99).\n\n*[OSHC]: Outside School Hours Care",

These fees do not form part of\nthe session of care fee that a family’s Child Care Subsidy was calculated on,\nmeaning that services can continue to charge administrative fees, for example,\nlate pick-up fees. However, services are not to increase these fees for the\nduration of the Relief Package or add new ones that were not listed in a\nfamily’s Complying Written Agreement.</p>\n<p>The department can take compliance action against services not meeting the\nconditions of the payments.
