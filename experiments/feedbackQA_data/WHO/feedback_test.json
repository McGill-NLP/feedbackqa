In general, alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol,\npropan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped\nviruses like SARS-CoV-2, in concentrations of 70-80% with one-minute exposure\ntime. Chlorine-based disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite) are effective for\nsurface decontamination, as are disinfectants with active ingredients based on\nquaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS).</p>\n<p>All staff should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds after any contact\nwith someone who is unwell with symptoms consistent with coronavirus\ninfection. Staff engaged in environmental cleaning should wear PPE when\nperforming cleaning activities, such as overalls or uniform, single-use\nplastic aprons, gloves and a face mask. Protective clothing (e.g. uniforms,\noveralls, etc.) should be frequently washed at 60°C or above.</p>"

The serial interval for\nCOVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the\nserial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than\nCOVID-19.  \nFurther, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-\nsymptomatic transmission –transmission of the virus before the appearance of\nsymptoms – is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while\nwe are learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours\nprior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver\nof transmission.  \nThe reproductive number – the number of secondary infections generated from\none infected individual – is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19\nvirus, higher than for influenza. However, estimates for both COVID-19 and\ninfluenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct\ncomparisons more difficult.  \nChildren are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the\ncommunity. For COVID-19 virus, initial data indicates that children are less\naffected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are\nlow. Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China\nsuggest that children are infected from adults, rather than vice versa.  \nWhile the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with\nsevere disease appears to be different. For COVID-19, data to date suggest\nthat 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection,\nrequiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. These\nfractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is\nobserved for influenza infection.  \nThose most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant\nwomen, elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who\nare immunosuppressed. For COVID-19, our current understanding is that older\nage and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection.  \nMortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal\ninfluenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully\nunderstand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio\n(the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%,\nthe infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the\nnumber of infections) will be lower.
