They should\navoid touching people, surfaces and objects and be advised to cover their\nmouth and nose with a disposable tissue when they cough or sneeze and put the\ntissue in a bag or pocket and then dispose of the tissue in a bin.

Alcohol based sanitizers/surface disinfectants should be used for\ncleaning purposes. In general, alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol,\npropan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity\nof enveloped viruses like COVID-19 virus, in concentrations of 70-80%.

If they become unwell at any time within their\n14-day isolation period and they test positive for COVID-19, they will become\na confirmed case, and should be managed as such.\nStaff who have not had close contact with the original confirmed case should\ncontinue taking the usual precautions and attend work as usual.

In a study of environmental contamination in\na Chinese hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in\nenvironmental samples from the COVID-19 dedicated intensive care units (ICU),\nthe COVID-19 dedicated obstetric isolation ward and the COVID-19 dedicated\nisolation ward. SARS-CoV-2 was also detected on objects such as the self-\nservice printers used by patients to self-print the results of their exams,\ndesktop keyboards and doorknobs. Virus was detected most commonly on gloves\n(15.4% of samples) and rarely on eye protection (1.7%) [6]. This evidence\nshows the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment of a COVID-19 patient,\ntherefore reinforcing the belief that fomites play a role in transmission of\nSARS-CoV-2; however, the relative importance of this route of transmission\ncompared to direct exposure to respiratory droplets is still unclear.</em></p>"

For this reason, it is imperative that the\ndifferent values be weighed and applied to specific allocation issues using a\nfair process.\nA fair process for allocating scarce resources must promote certain ethical\nvalues:\n\nTransparency. In a transparent process, the decisions and their justifications should be made public. This means that the population should be informed about the criteria guiding the decisions.\nInclusiveness. Those affected by allocation decisions \u2013 including individuals, communities or countries \u2013 should be able to exert at least some influence over the decision-making process as well as the decision itself. This also means that decisions 4 should be open to challenge and potentially revisable, perhaps through an appeal process. \nConsistency. Decisions should be consistent so that all persons in the same categories are treated in the same way. This means that favouritism towards one\u2019s own family, religious or political compatriots, or otherwise, is not appropriate. All forms of corruption that are at variance with this principle should be challenged and condemned. \nAccountability. Those making decisions about allocation must be accountable for those decisions \u2013 that is, they should justify their decisions and be held responsible for them. A fair process means that allocation decisions should not be made by individuals, by individual pharmaceutical companies, or, in the case of allocation between countries, by a single country. Resources such as vaccines and therapies should not be stockpiled outside the system of fair allocation.\n\nThe fair allocation of resources is one that is valuable in itself precisely\nbecause it is fair. However, it may also be valuable because a fair system\nengenders solidarity and trust, which are vital to the successful and\nsustained collective response necessary for dealing effectively with any\noutbreak.",

For this reason, it is imperative that the\ndifferent values be weighed and applied to specific allocation issues using a\nfair process.</p>\n<p>A fair process for allocating scarce resources must promote certain ethical\nvalues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transparency.</strong> In a transparent process, the decisions and their justifications should be made public. This means that the population should be informed about the criteria guiding the decisions.</li>\n<li><strong>Inclusiveness.</strong> Those affected by allocation decisions \u2013 including individuals, communities or countries \u2013 should be able to exert at least some influence over the decision-making process as well as the decision itself. This also means that decisions 4 should be open to challenge and potentially revisable, perhaps through an appeal process. </li>\n<li><strong>Consistency.</strong> Decisions should be consistent so that all persons in the same categories are treated in the same way. This means that favouritism towards one\u2019s own family, religious or political compatriots, or otherwise, is not appropriate. All forms of corruption that are at variance with this principle should be challenged and condemned. </li>\n<li><strong>Accountability.</strong> Those making decisions about allocation must be accountable for those decisions \u2013 that is, they should justify their decisions and be held responsible for them. A fair process means that allocation decisions should not be made by individuals, by individual pharmaceutical companies, or, in the case of allocation between countries, by a single country. Resources such as vaccines and therapies should not be stockpiled outside the system of fair allocation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The fair allocation of resources is one that is valuable in itself precisely\nbecause it is fair. However, it may also be valuable because a fair system\nengenders solidarity and trust, which are vital to the successful and\nsustained collective response necessary for dealing effectively with any\noutbreak.</p>"

If possible, find a room or area where they can be\nisolated behind a closed door, such as a staff office. If it is possible to\nopen a window, do so for ventilation. Arrangements should be made for the\nunwell employee to be removed quickly from the food premise.\nThe employee who is unwell should follow national guidelines for reporting\ncases/suspect cases of COVID-19. Whilst they wait for medical advice or to be\nsent home, they should avoid any contact with other employees. They should\navoid touching people, surfaces and objects and be advised to cover their\nmouth and nose with a disposable tissue when they cough or sneeze and put the\ntissue in a bag or pocket and then dispose of the tissue in a bin. If they do\nnot have any tissues available, they should cough and sneeze into the crook of\ntheir elbow. If they need to go to the bathroom whilst waiting for medical\nassistance, they should use a separate bathroom, if available.\nAll surfaces that the infected employee has come into contact with must be\ncleaned. Alcohol based sanitizers/surface disinfectants should be used for\ncleaning purposes. In general, alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol,\npropan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity\nof enveloped viruses like COVID-19 virus, in concentrations of 70-80%. Common\ndisinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds\n(QUATS) and chlorine would also have virucidal properties. All staff should\nwash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds with soap and water after any\ncontact with someone who is unwell with symptoms consistent with coronavirus\ninfection.\nIf an employee is confirmed as a case of COVID-19 it will be necessary to\nnotify all close contacts of the infected employee so they too can take\nmeasures to minimise further risk of spread. WHO definitions of a contact of a\nCOVID-19 case can be found here. Examples of\ncontacts in the food businesses could include any employee who was in face-to-\nface or physical (i.e., touching) contact; any employee who was within 1 meter\nwith the confirmed case; anyone who has cleaned up any bodily fluids without\nadequate PPE (e.g. gloves, overalls, protective clothing); employees in the\nsame working team or workgroup as the confirmed case, and any employee living\nin the same household as a confirmed case.\nWHO recommends that contacts be quarantined for 14 days from the last\npoint of exposure to the confirmed case.22 At a minimum, staff who have had\nclose contact with the infected employee should be asked to stay at home for\n14 days from the last time they had contact with the confirmed case and\npractice physical distancing. If they become unwell at any time within their\n14-day isolation period and they test positive for COVID-19, they will become\na confirmed case, and should be managed as such.\nStaff who have not had close contact with the original confirmed case should\ncontinue taking the usual precautions and attend work as usual. Organising\nemployees into small teams or workgroups will help to minimise disruption to\nwork processes in the event of an employee reporting sick with symptoms of\nCOVID-19. Closure of the workplace is not recommended.\nMore detailed information can be found in COVID-19 and food safety: guidance\nfor food\nbusinesses.\nFor more information on contacts of COVID-19 confirmed cases, see WHO\nguidance on surveillance and case definitions.",

If they do\nnot have any tissues available, they should cough and sneeze into the crook of\ntheir elbow. If they need to go to the bathroom whilst waiting for medical\nassistance, they should use a separate bathroom, if available.</p>\n<p>All surfaces that the infected employee has come into contact with must be\ncleaned. Alcohol based sanitizers/surface disinfectants should be used for\ncleaning purposes. In general, alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol,\npropan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity\nof enveloped viruses like COVID-19 virus, in concentrations of 70-80%. Common\ndisinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds\n(QUATS) and chlorine would also have virucidal properties. All staff should\nwash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds with soap and water after any\ncontact with someone who is unwell with symptoms consistent with coronavirus\ninfection.</p>\n<p>If an employee is confirmed as a case of COVID-19 it will be necessary to\nnotify all close contacts of the infected employee so they too can take\nmeasures to minimise further risk of spread. WHO definitions of a contact of a\nCOVID-19 case can be found <a href=\"/publications-detail/global-surveillance-\nfor-human-infection-with-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\">here</a>. Examples of\ncontacts in the food businesses could include any employee who was in face-to-\nface or physical (i.e., touching) contact; any employee who was within 1 meter\nwith the confirmed case; anyone who has cleaned up any bodily fluids without\nadequate PPE (e.g. gloves, overalls, protective clothing); employees in the\nsame working team or workgroup as the confirmed case, and any employee living\nin the same household as a confirmed case.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/publications-detail/considerations-for-quarantine-of-\nindividuals-in-the-context-of-containment-for-coronavirus-\ndisease-(covid-19)\">WHO recommends</a> that contacts be quarantined for 14 days from the last\npoint of exposure to the confirmed case.22 At a minimum, staff who have had\nclose contact with the infected employee should be asked to stay at home for\n14 days from the last time they had contact with the confirmed case and\npractice physical distancing. If they become unwell at any time within their\n14-day isolation period and they test positive for COVID-19, they will become\na confirmed case, and should be managed as such.</p>\n<p>Staff who have not had close contact with the original confirmed case should\ncontinue taking the usual precautions and attend work as usual. Organising\nemployees into small teams or workgroups will help to minimise disruption to\nwork processes in the event of an employee reporting sick with symptoms of\nCOVID-19. Closure of the workplace is not recommended.</p>\n<p>More detailed information can be found in <a href=\"https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331705/WHO-2019-nCoV-\nFood_Safety-2020.1-eng.pdf\">COVID-19 and food safety: guidance\nfor food\nbusinesses</a>.</p>\n<p>For more information on contacts of COVID-19 confirmed cases, see <a href=\"/emergencies/diseases/novel-\ncoronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/surveillance-and-case-definitions\">WHO\nguidance on surveillance and case definitions</a>.</p>"

Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from\ninfection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time\nbetween successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for\nCOVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the\nserial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than\nCOVID-19.  \nFurther, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-\nsymptomatic transmission \u2013transmission of the virus before the appearance of\nsymptoms \u2013 is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while\nwe are learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours\nprior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver\nof transmission.  \nThe reproductive number \u2013 the number of secondary infections generated from\none infected individual \u2013 is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19\nvirus, higher than for influenza.

Speak to loved ones and people you trust every day or as much as possible, using the telephone, video-calls or messaging, through writing letters, etc. Use this time to share your feelings and to do common hobbies together. \n\n\n__\n\nBe physically active every day. Reduce long periods of sitting and set up a daily routine that includes at least 30 minutes of exercise. Make sure to do activities that are safe and appropriate for your level of physical fitness as indicated by your health-care worker. You can use household chores as a way to keep physically active, follow an on-line class (e.g. Tai Chi, yoga) or choose your favourite music and dance to that. __\n\n__\n\nDrink water and eat healthy and well-balanced meals. This will keep you hydrated, help strengthen your immune system and lower the risk of chronic illnesses and infectious diseases. __For nutrition advice click here.\n\n __\n\n\nAvoid smoking and drinking alcohol . Smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 because smoking can affect lung capacity and because the act of smoking increases the possibility of transmission of virus from hand to mouth. Drinking alcohol not only disturbs your sleep but may also increase your risk of falls, weaken your immune system, and interact with any prescription medicines that you are taking. Limit the amount of alcohol you drink or don\u2019t drink alcohol at all. \n\n\nTake breaks from news coverage about COVID-19 as prolonged exposure can cause feelings of anxiety and despair.

According to van Doremalen et al., the environmental stability of\nSARS-CoV-2 is up to three hours in the air post-aerosolization, up to four\nhours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on\nplastic and stainless steel, albeit with significantly decreased titres [3].\nThese findings are comparable with results obtained for environmental\nstability of SARS-CoV-1.

For example, if the event\ntakes place over several days in a small island state where the capacity of\nthe health system is quite limited then even an event with just a few thousand\nparticipants could place a big strain on the health system and then be\nconsidered a \u201cmass gathering\u201d event. Conversely, if the event is held in a big\ncity in a country with a large, well-resourced health system and lasts just a\nfew hours, the event may not constitute a \u201cmass gathering\u201d event.</p>"
